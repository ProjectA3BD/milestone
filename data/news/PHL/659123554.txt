Meanwhile, 18 members of the Maute Group were killed in a fresh gun battle as government troops cleared two bridges heading towards Bangulo. This brings the fatalities on the terrorist groups to 31 from 13 on the previous day.

“As of this report, 31 terrorists were already neutralized and six high-powered firearms were recovered by the troops,” Brig. Gen. Rolando Bautista, commander of the Army’s 1st Infantry Division, said.

“Our troops are doing deliberate operations in the areas we believe are still occupied or infested with the terrorists’ presence,” he added.

In a news briefing earlier, the military said it had also launched “precision” air strikes to go after the remaining 30 to 40 members of the Maute Group scattered in parts of the city.
