MANILA - The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) will honor outstanding OFW families in a ceremony to be held on Friday in Paranaque.

It's all systems go for the announcement of the grand national winners of the 2014 Most Outstanding OFW Family Award (MOFYA), according to OWWA Administrator Rebecca Calzado.

“We are truly proud of all our MOFYA awardees, both past, the new roster as well as the future winners, because they exemplify what every OFW aspires for—success both in their work stints abroad and a happy, fulfilled family life,” Calzado said.

Two families, one each from the land- and sea-based categories, from among the 34 OWWA Regional winners will be chosen as national winners.

Two special awards, the "Outstanding Achievement in Community Projects", and the "Outstanding Achievement in Entrepreneurship" titles shall be conferred among deserving finalists.

Labor Secretary Rosalinda Baldoz said the criteria for the selection of the regional and national MOFYA awardees include wholesomeness of the family, success in their profession, success in business and financial management, and civic or community involvement or leadership.

MOFYA exemplifies family solidarity among Filipinos, who, despite distance, continue to show support to one another.

The 2 grand winners will each receive a trophy and a cash prize of P500,000 plus a refrigerator.

In addition, each of the two special awards winners will get a plaque of recognition, a cash prize of P100,000 and a refrigerator.

Meanwhile, the 34 regional winners will each receive a cash prize of P40,000.

All MOFYA finalists/nominees will also be given a MOFYA trophy and P100,000 insurance coverage for two family members, per family.
