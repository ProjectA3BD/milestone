Dear Reader,

As you can imagine, more people are reading The Jerusalem Post than ever before. Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analyses from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.

As one of our loyal readers, we ask you to be our partner.

For $5 a month you will receive access to the following:

A user experience almost completely free of ads

Access to our Premium Section

Content from the award-winning Jerusalem Report and our monthly magazine to learn Hebrew - Ivrit

A brand new ePaper featuring the daily newspaper as it appears in print in Israel

Help us grow and continue telling Israelâ€™s story to the world.

Thank you,

Ronit Hasin-Hochman, CEO, Jerusalem Post Group

Yaakov Katz, Editor-in-Chief
