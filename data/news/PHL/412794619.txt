FIVE soldiers have been killed in an attack by suspected communist rebels in the northern Philippines, the military says.

THE troops were on their way back to headquarters after a patrol on Thursday evening when the guerrillas opened fire at them along a road in the town of Quirino in Ilocos Sur province, 285 kilometres south of Manila.
