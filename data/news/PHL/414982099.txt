Investigators believe Australians were among the clients of Peter Gerard Scully, the Melbourne man whose alleged sex crimes against babies and children in the Philippines have renewed calls for the south-east Asian country to reintroduce the death penalty.

A 13 year-old girl from an impoverished family, who has emerged as Scully's latest alleged victim, has told police she was supposed to meet one of his Australian clients and perform lewd sex acts in front of a camera.

But the girl said plans were changed at the last minute and Scully instead tried to sell her to a German man for the equivalent of $2924.

She told police when she heard she was going to be sold she ran away from Scully's rented house.
