OTTAWA - The RCMP is conducting a criminal investigation into the murder of hostage John Ridsdel in the Philippines.

The Mounties are relying on the extraterritorial provisions of the Criminal Code in pursuing the overseas investigation, a senior official says.

It means the perpetrators, if found and charged, could one day face justice under Canadian law.

The official spoke with The Canadian Press on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the ongoing hostage case.
