IT was a very special Australia Day for the Asuelo family, who pledged their allegiance to Australia and its people.

The Kilcoy family of five, formerly of the Philippines, joined 16 other Somerset residents in becoming Australian citizens at the Somerset Australia Day Awards and Citizenship Ceremony held in Esk.

"This is a very special day for our family and we feel very lucky to call Australia home," Rowena Asuelo said.

New citizens were also sworn in from South Africa, the United Kingdom and New Zealand.

Australia Day celebrations started at the Somerset Civic Centre at 7.30am where 200 residents were treated to a free buffet breakfast before attending the combined Australia Day Awards presentation and citizenship ceremony.

Somerset Mayor Graeme Lehmann said it was great to see so many residents come together to celebrate what's great about Australia.

"Today is the day we come together to reflect on what we have achieved and what we can be proud of in our great nation," Cr Lehmann said.
