Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte has issued shoot-to-kill orders against elected officials, telling one mayor he should be shot "like a dog" because of his alleged involvement in drugs.

The man known as "The Punisher" says he plans within days to name 27 mayors, judges and national politicians who he claims are involved in the drug trade who will not be exempt from his shoot-to-kill orders if they resist arrest.

Two mayors wept before him and pleaded to be taken off the list while two others offered to resign from their positions.

Human rights groups have called for Mr Duterte to halt the killings as the body count grows to more than 600, many of them by unknown assailants or vigilante groups.
