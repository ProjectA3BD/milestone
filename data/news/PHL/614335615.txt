A top Philippine militant who pledged allegiance to Islamic State has been killed in the group's latest setback in its attempts to sow terror across south-east Asia.

The killing of Mohammad Jaafar Maguid during a firefight with security forces in the southern Philippines early Thursday followed the foiling of an alleged Islamic State plot to carry out attacks in Myanmar to show support for persecuted Rohingya Muslims.

Malaysian counter-terrorism officials say they have detained an Islamic State follower who was planning to travel to Myanmar to carry out attacks.

The Indonesian man has been charged with possession of materials linked to terrorism.
