The FBI has confirmed the death of Bali bomber Marwan, a senior Malaysian militant with a $US5 million ($A6.58 million) reward on his head, in a January raid in the Philippine that also left 44 police commandos dead.

The confirmation provides some validation for the botched raid that plunged President Benigno Aquino's administration into crisis and jeopardised efforts to end a decades-long Muslim separatist insurgency.

"After a thorough review of forensic data and information obtained from our Philippine law enforcement partners, the FBI has assessed that terrorism subject, Zulkifli Abdhir, also known as `Marwan,' is deceased and has been removed from the FBI's list of Most Wanted Terrorists," the US law-enforcement agency said on Thursday in a statement.

The raid claimed the lives of 44 members of the Philippine police Special Action Force (SAF) who were attacked by Muslim gunmen after they raided Zulkifli's hideout on January 25.
