JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesia's president said Tuesday he will not accept any attempts by other countries to halt the execution of foreign drug traffickers.

The government has announced plans to execute eight people — one Indonesian and seven foreigners from Australia, Brazil, France, Ghana, Nigeria and the Philippines.

President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo told reporters that the death penalty is part of the country's legal system.

"I need to say explicitly that there shouldn't be intervention in the issue of the executions because of our legal and political sovereignty," Jokowi said. He added that he has received phone calls from some foreign leaders asking that the executions be canceled, but rejected their requests.

In January, the government brushed aside appeals from several countries and executed an Indonesian and five foreigners from Malawi, Nigeria, the Netherlands and Vietnam who were convicted of drug trafficking.

Also Tuesday, Jakarta's Administrative Court dismissed an attempt by Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran to avoid execution by challenging Jokowi's rejection of their appeal for clemency. The court ruled that clemency is a prerogative of the president.

Jokowi has said he will reject all clemency appeals from drug offenders because Indonesia is suffering from a "drug emergency."

There are 133 people on death row in the country, including 57 for drug crimes.
