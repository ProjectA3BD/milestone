Manila: Philippine security forces killed at least 15 al-Qaeda-linked Islamist militants in an attempt on Wednesday to rescue foreign captives on a remote southern island, an army general said as Manila redoubled an offensive against Muslim rebels.

There was no immediate word on the fate of 10 foreign and Filipino hostages, including two Malaysians and a Dutch national, believed to be in the custody of Abu Sayyaf militants on Jolo Island.

Brigadier-General Alan Arrojado, commander of military units on Jolo island, said they fired several howitzer rounds as US-trained army commandos battled about 100 Abu Sayyaf militants near another rebel stronghold in the town of Indanan.

"We killed 15 rebels and wounded an undetermined number as they withdrew deep into the jungles," Arrojado told journalists by phone from his base. "We are pursuing them, we have sent in more reinforcements." No army casualties were reported.
