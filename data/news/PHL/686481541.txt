A Philippine government agency on Monday said a murder complaint would be filed against policemen who shot dead a teenager accused of robbery, the second such case in just over a week against police from the same part of the capital, Manila.



The body of Arnaiz was found on Aug. 28 by his parents at a morgue.



He was last seen alive on Aug. 17, according to media, which, citing a police report, said Arnaiz was accused of robbing a taxi driver and died in an ensuing firefight with police.
