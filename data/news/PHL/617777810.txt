A South Korean man who was kidnapped in the Philippines last year was recently found dead, the foreign ministry said Tuesday.

The 50-something man surnamed Ji was abducted on Oct. 18 and seems to have been strangled to death on that same day, a ministry official said, quoting the Philippine police agency's recent notice. (Yonhap)
