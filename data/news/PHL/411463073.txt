He says he didn’t do it.

“Detained Senator Bong Revilla has denied reports he sneaked out from his detention place and visited Senate Minority Leader Juan Ponce Enrile, as alleged by state prosecutors,” reports Hannah Torregoza in Manila Bulletin.

The report noted: “In an emailed statement, Revilla said he was rushed to the Philippine National Police (PNP) General Hospital after his blood pressure went up.”

Revilla related: “Reports that I was sneaked out by PNP personnel from the Custodial Center are absolutely false.”

The state prosecutors had claimed that Revilla reportedly left the detention compound on Valentine’s Day (Feb 14) to visit Enrile whose birthday also falls on the same date. However, the detained senator explained that “at about 3 p.m. that day, he was rushed to the PNP General Hospital after experiencing cold sweats, stiffness and pain on the back of head and neck, and a debilitating migraine attack.”

He disclosed, “I was taken to the hospital by Custodial Center Guards after a written request was made to Col. Fabro, the Director of the Custodial Center. I was accompanied by my two children, Bryan and (Cavite Vice Governor) Jolo.”

Revilla added: “I stayed in the hospital for less than 30 minutes and was immediately taken back to my detention cell to rest, after my blood pressure was taken and injected with medication.”

The report pointed out that “Enrile, Revilla, and Sen. Jinggoy” Estrada are all detained at the PNP headquarters after they were implicated in the PHP10-billion pork barrel fund scam.”
