MANILA, Philippines - Fulfilled. Accomplished. Enriched.

Steadfast in its role of helping to create more life-changing opportunities for generations of Filipino artists and scholars, the Asian Cultural Council Philippines Foundation (ACCPF) has remained magnanimous in its modest effort to help more and more individuals and organizations benefit from its Fellowship Program.

Now celebrating its 15th year, the ACCPF, in partnership with the Asian Cultural Council, continues in its profound commitment of championing creative excellence and nurturing artistic potential. To date, the ACCPF has over 60 grantees amongst its distinguished alumni.

Since its establishment in 2000, the ACCP in alliance with ACC New York raises funds and promotes awareness to support international dialogue, understanding and respect through cultural exchange.

By way of a Fellowship Program, grants are awarded to select individuals and organizations across such artistic fields as archaeology, architecture, art history, arts administration, arts criticism, film, photography & video, conservation, crafts, dance, design, literature, museology, music, new media, painting, sculpture & installation, printmaking, and theater.

This year ACC Philippines marks its anniversary with an art auction in partnership with Leon Gallery. Eminent names and ACC friends in the arts pledged their support by participating in this fundraising event. With a preview exhibit starting today, the fundraising auction is set on Feb. 7 at 2 p.m. at Leon Gallery, G/F Eurovilla 1, Rufino cor. Legaspi Sts. Legaspi Village, Makati City.
