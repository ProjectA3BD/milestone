Manila: Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte threatened to withdraw the country’s membership in the United Nations (UN) amid calls from rights experts to put an end to extrajudicial killings.

Duterte hit out at the UN’s supposed meddling in state affairs when special rapporteurs from the intergovernmental body welcomed the challenge to look into the rising death toll attributed to the administration’s intensified war against illegal drugs.

“Maybe we just have to decide to separate from the United Nations,” Duterte said yesterday.

“If you are that rude, we might just as well leave,” he added.

Duterte said the UN special rapporteurs broke protocol when they aired a statement criticising his administration.

“You do not just throw that kind of allegations or statement without even coming here,” he said.

“You’re just relying on the reports of newspapers and tabloids. That’s what you do.”

Reminding the UN that he was not just a mayor anymore, the chief executive demanded to see the rapporteur in the Philippines or somewhere else.

“Let them talk to me and let them face me with hard facts,” he added.

Earlier, presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said the government did not extend any invitation to any third-party observer, adding that the drug situation is being responsibly addressed by Philippine authorities.

Duterte said the inutile UN, which could not end wars and maintain peace among its members, had not done any good for the Philippines.

“So take us out of your organisation. You have done nothing. Except to criticise,” he said.

“When have you done a good deed to my country?

He brought out the possibility of forming a new intergovernmental organisation with China and African countries. — Philippine Daily Inquirer / Asia News Network
