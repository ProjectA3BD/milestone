Controversial Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has ordered his security forces to bomb kidnap-for-ransom groups operating in the country's southern islands, even if hostages are killed.

"Even if they are kidnappers and they are trying to escape, blow them up," Mr Duterte told businessmen in his home city of Davao.

Referring to hostages, he said "sorry, collateral damage".

Mr Duterte said his hardline policy would make kidnap gangs such as the brutal Islamist group Abu Sayyaf think twice about taking hostages.
