At least 30 injured in resort-casino attack

MANILA (UPDATED) - The gunman who ran amok at Resorts World Manila early Friday morning was likely "addicted to gambling" who "went crazy," Metro Manila's police chief said.

National Capital Region Police Office Director Oscar Albayalde told ABS-CBN's Umagang Kay Ganda that there are no indications that the shooting spree was related to terrorism.



"Nakita po natin dito, siguro nalulong sa sugal ang taong ito at nabaliw na kaya pinuntirya niya ang casino," he said.

Albayalde said, based on CCTV footage, the suspect looked like he was acting alone.



"Lumalabas na nag-iisa siya, around 6-footer, parang puti ang complexion niya," he said.

Eyewitnesses earlier told police that they saw at least two gunmen who were wearing masks and black shirts, but Philippine National Police chief Ronald dela Rosa later said there was only one.

Dela Rosa later told ANC that the gunman has been killed.

Albayalde said the gunman carried a long firearm, which he described as similar to a "baby Armalite" or a small version of the M-16 assault rifle.



"Una, pumasok siya at nataranta ang security, dumiretso sa casino, nagsunog ng table, nagpaputok sa ere, pinaputukan ang LED TV," he said, explaining how the gunman was able to enter the casino.

Albayalde said the gunman went to the chips storage area and stole around P130 million worth of chips.

The suspect's bag containing the chip was later recovered, Dela Rosa said.

He said at least 30 people sustained injuries.

"May isang nasugatan due to gunshot wound pero buhay naman. May 81-year old na nahimatay, hindi pa alam kung patay o buhay ngayon," Albayalde said.
