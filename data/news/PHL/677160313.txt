Manila, July 30 (IANS) The Mayor of a southern Philippine city and seven others were killed in an anti-drug operation on Sunday, authorities said.

Several weapons and a large volume of crystal meth were seized following the operation against Ozamis Mayor Reynaldo Parojinog, Xinhua news agency reported.

An official said Parojinog’s daughter Nova Princess, the city’s Vice Mayor, was arrested at the family’s estate in San Roque Lawis village.

Parojinog’s wife Susan and Octavio Parojinog Jr, a member of the provincial legislative board, were among those killed.
