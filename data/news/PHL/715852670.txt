MANILA - A state of calamity was declared in Ormoc, Leyte following the devastation caused by tropical depression "Urduja", Mayor Richard Gomez confirmed.

"More work ahead. To the residents of this city Pls lend some of your valuable time to help our fellow Ormocanon," Gomez said in a Facebook post late Saturday.

Urduja destroyed 2,000 hectares of rice or about 90 percent of Tacloban's rice fields, Gomez told DZMM.

Three fatalities were reported during the typhoon's onslaught while 3 others were missing, he added.

A state of calamity means local officials can tap emergency funds for the evacuees and impose a price freeze on basic commodities.

The local government has distributed relief supplies to evacuees, but they need more blankets and drinking water, Gomez said.
