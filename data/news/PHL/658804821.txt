The Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) has backed the decision of President Rodrigo Duterte to declare martial law in Mindanao.

“The Constitution, under Article VII, Section 18, is very clear on the authority of the President to declare martial law, the extent of the authority, and the remedies and safeguards against the abuse of that authority,” read a statement from the IBP.

The IBP pointed out Marawi City got attacked by the local terror group Maute and, because of this, hostilities could spread to other parts of Mindanao and other terrorist groups could take advantage of the situation.

Because of the situation in Mindanao, the IBP stated it “sees no reason to question the declaration at this time.”

On the other hand, it assured the public that the declaration of martial law will “not result to any diminution of their rights.”

The IBP said that “civil and judicial authorities will continue to function except in places where the continuation of such functions has been rendered difficult.”

It cited the Supreme Court (SC) has already given a directive to have all courts in Mindanao open and to continue to perform their duties and functions.

While martial law remains in effect, the IBP urged the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) as well as other law enforcement agencies to “wield this power with caution and regard for the rule of law.”

“The IBP supports all legal means to end this unrest in Mindanao and encourages the achievement of peace through lawful means,” it said.

“We will remain steadfast in our commitment to uphold and defend the Constitution and vigilant against those who intend to curtail democracy and our fundamental freedom,” the IBP assured.
