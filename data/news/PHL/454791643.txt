FEATURE: Ex-soldier takes 20 years to overcome nightmares from war experience

UTSUNOMIYA, Japan, Aug. 2 â€” A former Imperial Japanese Navy soldier took some 20 years after the end of World War II to overcome nightmares from his experience in the Battle of Leyte.

Yoshiaki Waku, 91, was assigned to a fleet of 10 ships in November 1944 to transport army soldiers to Leyte in the Philippines from Manila. He was tasked with monitoring enemy ships.

At around noon a few days after departure from the Philippine capital, the fleet was suddenly attacked by U.S. aircraft when an arrival port came into sight. Waku and others jumped into the sea as their ship was hit hard. Other Japanese ships also sank one after another. (PNA/Kyodo)
