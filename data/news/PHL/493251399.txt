An inferno in one of Manila's huge shanty towns has killed nine people, authorities said Friday, the third blaze to have struck the city's slums in as many weeks.



The Damayang Lagi fire destroyed 50 houses, leaving an estimated 600 people homeless.



Altoveros vowed to rebuild the two-storey, wood and tin shack he used to share with his wife and two teenage children.



A fire in 2009 razed an earlier structure they called home, but they did not leave Damayan Lagi because they did not own land.



Last week, 5,000 people were left homeless after a huge blaze gutted 500 tin-roofed huts in the city's old quarter.



In late November, about 800 homes went up in smoke in another Manila shanty town.



In May, 72 died when a fire tore through a Manila footwear factory.
