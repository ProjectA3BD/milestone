Bangkok: When Rodrigo Duterte was elected president of the Philippines last year, he vowed to wipe out his country's drugs trade in six months. He said fish in Manila Bay would grow fat from the bodies of drugs suspects.

Now after the greatest loss of civilian lives in the hands of authorities in south-east Asia since the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia in the 1970s on Tuesday, Mr Duterte says the illegal drug problem is so enormous that it will take a lot longer and harsher action to solve.

"Look, this shabu [ice] and drugs problem cannot be solved by one man or a president for one term," he said.

"America is under siege because of drugs and they are far worse than us."
