Flights have also been cancelled and thousands of people have been warned to evacuate flood-prone areas as powerful Typhoon Koppu bears down on the Philippines.

The country's President Benigno Aquino has directly appealed for help from Filipinos as authorities try to prevent casualties.

"I must emphasise (that) each local government unit, community, and Filipino that will be affected has the duty to cooperate ... to overcome the challenges ahead," he said.

It is the first time he has appeared on television to personally issue a storm warning since typhoon Haiyan battered the country in November 2013, leaving thousands of people dead or missing.

Disaster agency officials are urging people living in low-lying areas or staying at beach-side resorts to make their way to safer areas because of the risk of flooding and storm surges.

The typhoon is slowly moving west and due to make landfall on Saturday night local time. It is already packing sustained wind speeds of up to 100 mph (160 kilometres per hour).

Forecasters predict the storm could dump around half a metre of rain, bringing with it the risk of major landslides and flooding.

"Let us not wait to be told to evacuate," forecaster Adzar Aurelio said. "Let us evacuate and find the safe places."

Mr Aquino said government officials were preparing to provide relief assistance to an estimated 7.5 million people.

Koppu will be the 12th storm to hit the Philippines this year. An average of 20 storms pummel the country annually.
