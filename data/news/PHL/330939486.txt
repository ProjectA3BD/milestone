KIDAPAWAN CITY, Philippines – Local officials of North Cotabato and the relatives and friends of Binibining Pilipinas-Universe 2014 Mary Jean ”MJ” Lastimosa are confident she will take home the Miss Universe crown.

“She is intelligent, smart and beautiful. Most importantly, she’s a very fine woman,” Gov. Emmylou Taliño-Mendoza yesterday said.

Born and raised in North Cotabato, Lastimosa left for the United States last Jan. 3.

The beauty pageant, with contestants from 86 other countries, will be held in Miami, Florida on Jan. 25.

In a message e-mailed to reporters, Lastimosa said she would do her best to win the crown.

“There is always an ideal time for everything under heaven. If we fail, we can keep pursuing our dreams,” she said.

Lastimosa won the Binibining Pilipinas-Universe crown on March 30, 2014 – after two attempts in 2011 and 2012.

She said she is elated with the support of various sectors in North Cotabato.

“I wish to thank in advance those who are praying for me, praying hard for me to bring home the crown. I can’t thank them all enough,” she said.

The office of the governor sponsored Lastimosa’s participation in the Binibining Pilipinas pageant.
