Gangster suspected in murder of Japanese national in Manila arrested

MANILA (TR) â€“ A criminal investigation group has arrested the leader of a notorious gang suspected in the murder of a Japanese national last year, reports Nippon News Network (Jan. 22).

On Tuesday afternoon, officers from an anti-organized crime unit of the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group apprehended Ami Magnaan, the head of the Magnaan Gapos Gang, on a road in Navotas City.

A warrant for the arrest of Magnaan had previously been issued by a Manila court on charges of murder and robbery.

On May 17 of last year, Magnaan is alleged to have stabbed Tomoyuki Takasugi, 28, to death inside a residence in the Malate Bayview Mansion.

According to Philippine Daily Inquirer (Jan. 20), Takasugi once employed Magnaan as a maintenance worker at a bar he owned in Manila. Magnaan allegedly killed Takasugi after the two engaged in an argument over lighting in the establishment.

Magnaan also allegedly removed 800,000 Philippine Pesos from a safe belonging to Takasugi.

The Magnaan Gapos Gang is known in Manila and nearby provinces for robberies in which the hands and feet of the victims are tied.

Magnaan is also wanted in a murder that took place in April of 2009 in Bataan Province.
