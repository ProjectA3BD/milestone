A Maguindanao town mayor tagged by President Rodrigo Duterte as one of the country’s narco-politicians was killed when he and his armed escorts figured in a gunfight with police in an anti-drug operation in North Cotabato Friday dawn, October 28.

Samsudin Dimaukom, mayor of Datu Saudi Ampatuan, Maguindanao, and his nine companions were pronounced dead on arrival at the Makilala Medical Specialist Hospital, said Supt. Bernard Tayong of the North Cotabato police.

Dimaukom was known as “pink mayor” because he had the town hall painted in pink.

Tayong said police anti-illegal drug task force laid down a checkpoint along a highway in Barangay Old Bulatukan, Makilala at 4:30 a.m. when they flagged down Dimaukom’s three vehicles.

“It was a legitimate anti-drug operation but the subjects opened fire on our troops,” said Supt. Romeo Galgo Jr. of Police Regional Office 12.

Tayong said the checkpoint was put up after authorities received reports that Dimaukom will transport stocks of shabu to Maguindanao from Davao City.

Galgo said authorities are still evaluating the firearms and illegal drugs carried by the suspects.

A witness who saw the crime scene said a police car and a passenger van believed to be in Dimaukom’s convoy was riddled with bullets.
