A 74-year-old British man wanted by police in Bristol in connection with child sex abuse allegations has been detained in the Philippines.

Douglas Slade was arrested at the request of the UK authorities, said Elaine Tan from the Immigration Commission.

He has lived in Angeles City in the Philippines for around 10 years.

Avon and Somerset Police said the offences were alleged to have taken place in the 1970s and 80s.

The force told the BBC it was aware of reports that a man had been arrested by immigration authorities in the Philippines.

"We can confirm this man is wanted by Avon and Somerset Police in connection with non-recent sex offences committed mainly in the Bristol area," the force said.

The force added the investigation currently involves seven victims, who are all now adults.

Police said they were "working with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, National Crime Agency and Crown Prosecution Service following this latest development".

Mr Slade is being held at an immigration detention centre awaiting deportation proceedings.
