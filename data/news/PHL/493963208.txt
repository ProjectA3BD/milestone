Storm surges of up to 3.6 metres are expected as Typhoon Melor bears down on the Philippines.

Aid group CARE has emergency teams on standby as the category three storm, known locally as Nona, is set to make landfall on Monday night with winds of up to 150km/h and flash floods and landslides predicted.

"This storm is looking big and heading straight for communities that were devastated just two years ago by Typhoon Haiyan," CARE's acting country director in the Philippines Tess Bayombong said in a statement.
