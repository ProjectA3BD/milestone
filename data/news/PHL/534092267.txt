Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has confirmed the death of a Canadian hostage in the Philippines and put out a statement condemning the action of his hostage takers.

John Ridsdel, from Calgary, is a former mining executive who was taken hostage September 21, 2015.

On April 25 he was executed by his captors.

“Canada condemns without reservation the brutality of the hostage-takers, and this unnecessary death,” said Trudeau, in a statement. “This was an act of cold-blooded murder and responsibility rests squarely with the terrorist group who took him hostage.”

In November 2015, a terrorist organization posted a video online demanding about $100 million for four hostages, including Ridsdel and another Canadian man.

Ridsdel was 68 when he was taken hostage by a jihadish group in the Philippines, who are seen in the video raising long knifes to the necks of the hostages.

Trudeau said the Government of Canada will work with the Government of Philippines to find those responsible for the “heinous act” and bring them to justice.

Trudeau also offered condolences to Ridsdel’s family and friends.

“They have endured a terrible ordeal, and this is a devastating moment for all of them,” he continued. “Our thoughts are with them as they come to terms with this loss.

“The Government of Canada’s first priority is the safety and security of its citizens.”

Trudeau said they won’t be releasing further information on the incident which could compromise ongoing efforts or endanger remaining hostages.
