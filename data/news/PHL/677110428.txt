DAVAO CITY – Mayor Reynaldo Parojinog and six others were killed in a series of raids conducted by police authorities in San Roque Lawis in Ozamiz City on Sunday.

Chief Supt. Timoteo Pacleb, the Northern Mindanao police chief, said elements of the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) were simultaneously serving six search warrants against properties of the mayor and other Parojinog family members for drugs and firearms when they were met with violent resistance at about 2:30 a.m.

“The serving PNP personnel were met with volley of fire from their security prompting PNP personnel to retaliate,” Pacleb said in a media statement.

He said seven persons were killed including Mayor Parojinog.

The Catholic-owned Radio dxDD in Ozamiz said the other slain during the operations were Parojinog’s wife, Susan; Misamis Occidental Board member Octavio Parojinog Jr., a Lydia and JR of Lumad TV, civilian volunteer members Miguel del Victoria, Nestor Cabalan, and Daniel D. Vasquez.

In an interview over radio dzMM, Pacleb confirmed the death of Susan and Octavio.

He added that he had received reports that a total of 12 persons were killed in the raids.

A policeman was also wounded in an explosion in one of the locations but the lawman was already out of danger, the official said.

Pacleb said Parojinog’s daughter, Vice Mayor Nova Echaves, was arrested and was being investigated by the Misamis Occidental police office.

Reports also said several firearms and suspected shabu were seized from the houses owned by Parojinog and that of his family members.

President Rodrigo Duterte has tagged the Parijinogs as among the narcopoliticians operating in Mindanao.
