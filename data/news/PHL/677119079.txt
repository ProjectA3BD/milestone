Philippine police say a mayor who has been listed by the president as among politicians linked to illegal drugs and six others have been killed in a raid in the country's south.

Police say officers were to serve warrants for the arrest of Mayor Reynaldo Parojinog Sr., his daughter, who is the vice mayor, and four other officials of Ozamiz city early Sunday when the suspects allegedly opened fire.

Police Chief Superintendent Timoteo Pacleb says an ensuing gunbattle killed Parojinog and six relatives and bodyguards in his house.

Parojinog's daughter, Vice Mayor Nova Echaves, was arrested.

Parojinog had denied any links to illegal drugs.

Thousands of mostly poor suspects have died in President Rodrigo Duterte's bloody crackdown on drugs that has been criticized by Western governments and human rights groups.
