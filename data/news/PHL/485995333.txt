Malaysia 'sickened' by citizen's beheading in Philippines

MANILA, Philippines (AP) â€” Malaysia's prime minister has urged Philippine authorities to punish kidnappers who reportedly beheaded a Malaysian man in the southern Philippines, saying he and his people are "shocked and sickened" by the savage act.

The Philippine military said it is verifying intelligence reports that the militants killed Bernard Then Ted Fen in a jungle in Sulu province, where the militants are holding other captives.

Prime Minister Najib Razak called on authorities late Tuesday to take action against those behind "this savage and barbaric act."
