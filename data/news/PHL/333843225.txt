Art Fair Philippines: hip and happening







IF YOU WANT a bird’s-eye view of Philippine contemporary art, one way to do it is to go to Art Fair Philippines. Running from Feb. 5 to 8, the event gathers exhibits of artists who are currently rocking the scene and those who aren’t big on publicity but are creating brilliant work.

Since its inception in 2013, interest in the Art Fair has been growing, said the organizers. From 6,000 visitors the first year, it drew 10,000 the next year. From having 25 galleries participating and three solo shows, they had 28 galleries and seven special exhibits last year, and for this year, 33 galleries (eight of which are from abroad) and 13 special exhibits. The space that the fair occupies has similarly expanded. From 2,780 square meters; it went to 3,468; and then to 4,423.



As to what makes the Art Fair successful, Ms. Araneta said that they invite “strong galleries.” The artists these galleries handle “are active in the scene, have local and international networks, and have with links to local and foreign institutions.” The organizers said they don’t tell these galleries what to do, but they encourage them to create good shows.



“It can’t be tiangge style,” said Ms. Araneta. “There has to be a concept.”



SPECIAL EXHIBITS AND MORE

Aside from gallery shows, there will be special exhibits featuring critically and commercially acclaimed artists, said Ms. Lopa during a press conference on Jan. 12.



Roberto Feleo, an artist and a professor who has influenced many young artists, will be featured at the central exhibit space at the sixth level. He will be debuting human-sized sculptures that are rooted in the Basi Revolt, a chapter in Philippine history where Ilocanos rebelled against Spain because the colonizers banned the private production of basi or sugarcane wine. The sculptures were commissioned by the Ilocos Norte government to commemorate the event.



“He’s a very low key, unheralded artist, but he works with so much conviction,” said Ms. Lopa of Mr. Feleo. “If you see his works, you will realize how much influence he’s exerted on a lot of artists working today,” she said, listing young artists such as Rodel Tapaya, Kawayan de Guia, and Leeroy New.



“Another reason why we are doing this fair is to expand the exposure of local audiences,” said Ms. Lopa. “We also want to get artists who are unexpected.”



On the seventh level, there will be special exhibits featuring works by Poklong Anading, Annie Cabigting, Buen Calubayan, Mariano Ching and Yasmin Sison, Kawayan de Guia, Alfredo Esquillo, Jr., Geraldine Javier, and Maria Taniguchi. Mike Adrao’s drawings will be on display at the fair’s reception area.



In the past, the three ladies were the ones who conceptualized these special exhibits, but this year they invited Patrick Flores, Ph.D., curator of the Philippine pavilion to the 56th Venice Biennale and curator of the Vargas Museum, to help them with this task. “We chose him before he was selected for the Venice Biennale,” said Ms. Lopa, explaining that they picked him because he “has a great reputation and he’s easy to work with.”



During the fair, there will be a lecture series entitled “Christie’s Art Forum,” sponsored by the international auction house. There will also be museums tours, the details of which are yet to be announced.



The participating galleries are: 1335 Mabini, Altromondo, Archivo, Arndt, Art Cube, Artesan, Art Informal, Art Verite, Avellana Art Gallery, Blanc, Boston Gallery, CANVAS, Crucible, Edouard Malingue Gallery, Equator Art Projects, Finale Art File, Galeria Duemila, Galerie Michael Janssen, J Studio, MO_, Nova Gallery, Nunu Fine Art, Pablo, Paseo Gallery, ROH Projects, Salcedo Private View, Secret Fresh, Silverlens, TAKSU, The Drawing Room, Tin-Aw Art Gallery, Vinyl on Vinyl, and West Gallery.
