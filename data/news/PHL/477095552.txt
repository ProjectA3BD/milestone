Bangkok: A powerful typhoon hit north-eastern parts of the main Philippine island of Luzon early on Sunday, bringing what forecasters warn could be three days of devastating floods and landslides.

Unlike other storms that regularly hit the island nation, Typhoon Koppu is excruciatingly slow moving, with weather forecasters warning it will dump torrential rains and hammer more than 7 million people with ferocious winds until Tuesday.

A typhoon further east and a high pressure area north of the Philippines unusually trapped the storm in a "semi-stationary" position, forecasters said.

As the category four storm, which is called "Lando" locally, approached the Philippines it slowed to a crawl, packing wind gusts of 200 km/h with a cloud band more than 600 kilometres wide.
