Change has arrived, but it looks like somebody didn’t get the memo.

A few minutes past 3pm on Sun, Jul 3, a police officer identified as Police Officer 1 (PO1) Vincent Paul Bulacan Solares went amok and fired shots at the second floor of the Manila Police District (MPD) headquarters on United Nations Avenue.

“Solares reportedly attempted to shoot his fellow police officers. This resulted in a 15-minute lockdown. Cops from the homicide division and Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) unit were the ones who responded to the emergency. Solares was finally arrested at around 3:30pm,” reports Philstar.com.

Solares is currently in, erm, police custody.

“Authorities are now looking into the possible motive of Solares which includes personal problems due to family or money issues. He will also be subjected to a drug test. Solares may face administrative charges such as illegal discharge of firearm, insubordination, and gross misconduct. He may also face criminal charges of direct assault,” reports GMA News Online.
