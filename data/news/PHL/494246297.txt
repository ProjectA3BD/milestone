MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED 8:04 a.m.) â€” Typhoon Nona (international name Melor) continued to traverse the Sibuyan Sea as it approached the island of Banton, Romblon on Tuesday morning.

In its 7 a.m. advisory, state weather bureau PAGASA said the eye of "Nona" was spotted 40 kilometers east north northeast of Romblon, Romblon.

The cyclone sustains winds of up to 140 kilometers per hour (kph) near the center and gusts of up to 170 kph.

It is also expected to move west at 15 kph, along the southernmost part of Luzon. Nona is also likely to pass over Mindoro provinces this afternoon.

PAGASA also warned against flash floods and landslides over the areas under signals no. 2 and 3, while storm surges of up to 3 meters are possible.

AccuWeather Meteorologist Adam Douty said "Nona" will continue to weaken as it crosses the central areas of the Philippines into Tuesday, but its damaging wind gusts at over 130 kph will target the rest of souther Luzon.

"[Nona] is a very compact typhoon, so that will prevent its most devastating impacts from extending too far from its center," Douty said in a report Tuesday.

He said Metro Manila is likely to be affected by heavy rainfall, even as strong winds are expected to bypass the country's capital.

The weather agency says the cyclone system is forecasted to be at 205 kilometers northwest of San Jose, Occidental Mindoro by Wednesday morning, and will continue to head 270 kilometers west of Coron, Palawan on Thursday.
