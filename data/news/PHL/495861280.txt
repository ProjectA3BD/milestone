EDMONTON â€” Police say three suspects, including a 13-year-old, face first degree murder charges in connection with a pair of convenience store holdups in the Alberta capital that left two clerks dead.

Laylin Delorme, 24, Colton Steinhauer, 27, and the youth who can't be named were arrested Friday morning.

In addition to the murder charges, all three suspects face charges of robbery with a prohibited restricted firearm and being disguised with intent.

A police news release didn't say when the suspects will appear in court to face the allegations.

Police identified one of the victims on Friday as Karanpal Singh Bhangu, 35, and on Saturday, they identified the second victim as Ricky Massin Cenabre, 41.

Police said the clerks were working alone at two separate stores and didn't fight back when masked robbers walked in and shot them on Friday morning.

Ephraim Holganza, who knew Cenabre through the local Filipino community and recently sold a vehicle to him, said Cenabre was from the island province of Bohol in the Philippines and had been in Canada about four or five years.

He had a common-law wife in that country as well as a teenaged son.

"He was a good person, quiet. During our conversations, he said when he gets his permanent residency, he was going to enlist in the military," Holganza said.

Police chief Rod Knecht called the deaths "a barbaric and gratuitous act of violence" and "evil" when he spoke at a news conference on Friday afternoon.
