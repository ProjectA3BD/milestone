Bangkok: Militants allied to Islamic State have rampaged through a southern Philippine town, beheading a local police chief and kidnapping a priest and 10 parishioners, as more firefights broke out and buildings were set ablaze on Thursday.

Violence that erupted on Tuesday in Marawi, 830 kilometres south of Manila, has left at least 21 dead, 13 of them militants, and dozens wounded.

The militants have threatened to kill Father Chito Suganog and other hostages who were saying prayers when fighters stormed into St Mary's Cathedral in the town and took them as human shields.

Majul Gandamra, the town's mayor, told journalists that militants were still holed up in some buildings, surrounded by soldiers.
