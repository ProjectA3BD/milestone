Bangkok: Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has ordered a "cleansing" of rogue police and the disbandment of his country's anti-drugs unit after the abduction and killing of a South Korean businessman under the cover of his deadly drugs crackdown.

Mr Duterte admitted he is embarrassed by the strangulation of Jee Ick-joo in a botched kidnap-for-ransom operation inside the grounds of the national police headquarters, Camp Crame, which shocked foreigners living in the country and is now the subject of a parliamentary hearing.

"They could have killed, strangled him anywhere but to say it had to happen inside Camp Crame is really bad, we admit that. Something has to be corrected severely," he said.

But Mr Duterte also declared he would continue to push ahead with the crackdown that has left more than 7000 people dead since July, saying it would be extended until the end of his six-year term in office.
