Singapore Airlines Proud Sponser of NZFW

Singapore Airlines Becomes a Proud Sponsor of New Zealand Fashion Week 2015

Singapore Airlines is an official sponsor of New Zealand Fashion Week (NZFW) 2015, which will take place in August at the ANZ Viaduct Events Centre in Auckland.

“We are delighted to partner with such a prestigious event,” said Edwin Chiang, General Manager, Singapore Airlines New Zealand. “Singapore Airlines has always been committed to promoting local cultural events, and not only is NZFW a powerful economic influence, it is also one of the most exciting cultural exchanges in the region every year. Our strategic objectives are complementary: Singapore Airlines’ strong global presence will help NZFW attract top media and buyers from key markets and bring new opportunities for New Zealand designers, while at the same time giving Singapore Airlines the opportunity to engage with fashion-conscious Kiwis. NZFW has invited us into this world, and we’re happy to help bring the world to New Zealand fashion designers. It’s a perfect fit.”

Singapore Airlines will be handing out boarding passes to fashion-savvy guests who will be treated to a taste of its famous hospitality in a Singapore-themed lounge, where they can rest and relax between events. There they can enjoy a variety of refreshments, from tea and coffee to the iconic Singapore Sling. Singapore Airlines will also give NZFW attendees the chance to win a round-trip ticket to Singapore.

For the past fifteen years, NZFW has been the country’s biggest international fashion industry trade event, consistently growing in both revenue and reputation. NZFW showcases the latest and greatest fashion trends from New Zealand and attracts labels and buyers from all over the world, making it an important opportunity for Kiwi designers to reach global audiences.
