Dubai Duty Free was a Gold and Bronze awardee for the CSR Leadership Award and Best Environmental Excellence Award respectively, at the ninth Annual Global CSR and Summit Awards held last month in Malaysia.



Organised by the Pinnacle Group International, the Global CSR Awards 2017 was the first event in Malaysia, previously hosted in Singapore, Philippines and Indonesia. Considered as Asia’s Most Prestigious Recognition Awards programme for Corporate Social Responsibility, it recognises and honours companies for outstanding, innovative and world-class products, services, projects and programmes implemented in the past or present, demonstrating the company’s leadership, sincerity and on-going commitment in incorporating ethical values, compliance with legal requirements, and respect for individuals, communities and the environment in the way they do business.



Commenting on the two awards, Dubai Duty Free executive vice chairman and CEO, Colm McLoughlin said: "We are delighted to receive the CSR Leadership and Best Environmental Excellence Awards which motivates us to continue with our company wide efforts of improving sustainability and making a valuable contribution to society."



There were 146 entries received from all over the world and a final selection of 38 companies were awarded top honours in the 16 main award categories.
