Iris Worldwide, the ‘creative innovation network’ recently acquired by Korea’s Cheil Worldwide, has moved two strategists from its UK headquarters to Singapore to “super charge” Concise, its consulting, CRM and data strategy arm.

Sorcha John, who has been with Concise since 2010, and Will Hanschell, who joined the firm a year later, both join as directors with a brief to grow the business in Singapore, and bring in clients that want “a more insight-led proposition”.

Iris bought Concise in 2001 to broaden its offering and more effectively ‘marry the left and right brain’ by bringing creative and strategy closer together.

Luke Nathans, APAC CEO of Iris, said: “Our industry in APAC, and particularly Singapore, has enjoyed rapid growth over the last decade. For brands, this has meant there hasn’t necessarily been a need to optimise, or innovate their business or product.”

“But we are seeing a maturity coming to the market – there is a need to be much more commercially focused, competitive and agile. We need to move from managing customer relationships to actively enhancing customer participation.”

Hanschell added: “Our aim is to apply more science and rigour to our clients’ marketing strategies in Singapore. Growth in APAC will continue to be greater than in the west – but it is slowing down, and becoming much more competitive.

“We can provide our clients with a unique service; deeper, more commercially focused insights that will make their business stronger and optimise marketing spend – coupled with an outstanding creative product. This is true creative innovation, and the building blocks for true participation brands,” he said.
