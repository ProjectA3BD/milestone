SINGAPORE - A woman was charged in court on Friday with assaulting a condominium manager, spitting and splashing liquid from a drink can at him.

Tang Lei, 47, a Chinese national, also allegedly hit Mr Colvin Quek Choon Kiat, 67, on his face and arms, causing bruises and abrasions on his forehead, at the Simei Green condominium management office at about 11.40am on April 28.

She was then with her sister, who has not been charged.

The incidents were recorded on video, posted online and went viral.

The women apparently had an argument with the condo manager over access cards.

Tang's lawyer Christopher Ravijit Singh Gill said he had just been briefed.

She is out on $10,000 bail and her passport has been impounded.

A pre-trial conference is scheduled for June 10.

If convicted of causing hurt, she faces a jail term of up to two years and/or a fine of up to $5,000.

The penalty for using criminal force is three months' jail and/or a fine of up to $1,500 per charge.
