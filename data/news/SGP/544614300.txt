Dhaka, May 27(ANI): Six Bangladeshi workers detained last month in Singapore were today charged with financing terrorism.

The six, aged between 26 and 31 years, were among the eight men arrested between late March and early April.

Claiming to be members of the Islamic State in Bangladesh (ISB), the men were planning attacks back home hoping to topple the Bangladeshi government, reports Daily Star.

Their goal was to set up an Islamic State back home and bring it under the self-declared caliphate of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

The six men were charged with providing or collecting money for terrorism under the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act.

They were detained according to the Internal Security Act of Singapore (ISA).

They were brought to court in three separate armoured trucks under heavy armed escort.

Rahman was identified by the Ministry of Home Affairs last month as the group's ringleader.

Miah and Jabath, two of the six arrested, were also being charged with possession of finances for terrorist purposes under the same Act.

Except for Mamun, all accused told the court that they intend to plead guilty. The court will hear the matter next on May 31. (ANI)
