SINGAPORE, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- Both birth and marriage rates have increased in Singapore last year, with the number of marriages involving at least one citizen hit a record high since 1997, according to a press release issued by the National Population and Talent Division (NPTD) on Monday.

There were about 24,000 marriages involving at least one citizen in 2014, a 10-percent rise from last year, the highest number since 1997, NPTD said.

Total fertility rate has also risen to 1.25 last year from 1.19 the year before, NPTD said, adding that citizen births also increased from around 31,000 births in 2013, to about 33,000 births last year.

The increase in marriages is likely to be due in part to the greater availability of HDB flats, and in part to more Singaporeans, the children of Baby Boomers, entering marriageable age, the press release explained.

"I am delighted to see more Singaporeans finding love and joy from setting up new families with their loved ones and having children of their own. This is indeed a good SG50 present for Singapore as she celebrates her 50 years of independence. I hope that these positive trends will continue in Singapore's Jubilee year as we gain confidence in Singapore's future as a good place to raise our families, where many opportunities for education and jobs await our children," said Grace Fu, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office.

Singapore's fertility rate has been far below the replacement rate of 2.1 for years. The total fertility rate steadily dropped from 1.6 in 2000 to a record low of 1.16 in 2010. It bounced back to 1.2 in 2011, and further to 1.29 in 2012, partly thanks to the year of the dragon in the Chinese calendar being a popular year to have babies. But the fertility rate dropped again to 1.19 in 2013.

In order to encourage more couples to have babies, Singapore government has rolled out a series of packages, spending up to 2 billion Singapore dollars (1.48 billion U.S. dollars) on incentives such as baby bonus, supply of HDB flats for couples who are willing to have children and childcare services.

NPTD said it will continue to support Singaporean families to make it easier for both fathers and mothers to share the experience of bringing up their children.
