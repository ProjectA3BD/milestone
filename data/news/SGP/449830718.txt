SINGAPORE, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Home Spots, part of Changi Airport's celebration of Singapore's Golden Jubilee, were officially launched on Thursday.

The attractions, located throughout the three terminals at Changi Airport, feature tourist icons, local dishes and landmarks, and aims to reflect Singapore's past, present and future, which will last until the end of September.

A six-meter tall durian topiary and an exhibition showing Singapore's aviation history are highlights among the attractions. Changi Airport's master plan, which will give an insight to how the airport will look like when Terminal 5 opens in the mid-2020s, is also on show for the first time in public.

Robin Goh, spokesman for Changi Airport Group, said that these attractions were set up over the past month, but the conceptualization have started since October last year. On top of attractions detailing Singapore's culture, there are also exhibits explaining behind the scenes work at the airport.

Goh added that they wanted to present attractions which are entertaining, quirky and educational, and can have a good combination of Singapore's history and Changi's history.
