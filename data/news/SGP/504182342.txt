Tanapolan and Ruvy attacked two male victims as they were leaving a club in March last year

Two 25-year-old Indian-origin Singaporeans were on Wednesday sentenced to up to five years in jail for attacking two compatriots and seriously injuring one of them last year.

Jai Ganesh Tanapolan pleaded guilty on three charges, including two for rioting, and Dinesh Kumar Ruvy admitted to one count of rioting armed with a deadly weapon.



Tanapolan has been sentenced to five years in prison while Ruvy was given 4.5 years in jail. They will also get six strokes of the cane each, Channelnewsasia reported.



Tanapolan and Ruvy attacked two male victims as they were leaving a club in March last year.

Tanapolan, Ruvy and their accomplices kicked and punched fellow local Indians, Logesvaren Subramaniam and Sashi Kumar Asogan, before Ruvy used a chopper to slash Logesvaren's forearm.



The six attackers then fled the scene in two taxis.



Logesvaren's wife and Asogan found him crouched at a nearby taxi stand. They took him to a nearby hospital, where he underwent an 11-hour long operation.



The duo's four accomplices are currently serving jail terms of between 21 and 24 months for rioting.
