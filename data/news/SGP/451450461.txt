A CHINESE national, working as a croupier at the Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) casino, and his alleged Singaporean accomplice were each charged yesterday with nine additional counts of cheating at play.

The duo had already been charged on July 15 with one count each of cheating at play, and they both face 85 more similar charges.

Croupier Zhang Zhijiu, 40, is accused of colluding with casino patron Chua Lai Huat, 65, by using his position as a dealer of the RWS Three Card Poker table to give Chua an advantage.

Zhang’s alleged modus operandi was to reveal the value of the last playing card of the dealer’s deck by exposing it at an angle to Chua.

Both men were arrested on July 14, on the same day that they allegedly committed the offences, at about 6am. Casino chips worth S$6,000 (RM16,600) and other items believed to be used by the duo to facilitate the crime were also seized.

The case will next be mentioned on Aug 19.

The duo are currently out on bail of S$15,000 (RM41,590) each.

For each count of cheating at play by colluding under a fraudulent scheme or practice, each man could face up to seven years’ jail, a fine of up to S$150,000 (RM416,000) or both. — The Straits Times / Asia News Network
