SINGAPORE - A 24-year-old man has been arrested for alleged loan shark harassment.

Police said two such cases were reported at Block 264, Boon Lay Drive and Block 758, Jurong West Street 74 on Jan 21 and Feb 14 respectively.

The suspect was identified through images captured by police cameras and was arrested on Tuesday in Choa Chu Kang. A mobile phone was also seized.

In a statement on Wednesday, the police said preliminary investigations suggest that the suspect is a debtor-turned-harasser. He would carry out harassment acts at multiple public estates by splashing paint at the doors of debtors' residences and defacing the adjacent walls with loanshark-related grafitti.

Under the Moneylenders Act 2010 (Revised Edition), first-time offenders found guilty of loanshark harassment could be jailed up to five years, fined a minimum of $5,000 and up to $50,000 and receive between three and six strokes of the cane.
