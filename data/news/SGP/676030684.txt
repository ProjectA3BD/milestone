A taxi driver was caught on video crashing head on into a parked van before hitting reverse and crashing into an HDB block.

A Stomp contributor brought the video to Stomp's attention after it was circulated on Facebook and WhatsApp.

It is unclear where or when this happened.

When the taxi driver rammed into the van, he also pushed the van onto the grass patch behind it.

He then inexplicably went into reverse gear and slammed into an HDB block to the shock of residents who had come out of their flats to see what was happening.

Smoke could be seen coming from the vehicle and the taxi driver then continued to rev his engine although the vehicle stayed stationary.
