"The Government of Singapore stands ready to work with Indonesia to bring those responsible for such reprehensible acts of terror to justice. We extend our deepest condolences to the bereaved families and wish the injured a swift recovery," said an MFA.

It added that there are no reports of Singaporeans directly affected or injured in the attack.

Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said in a Facebook post on Thursday that he was "dismayed" to hear of the bomb blast and that his "deepest condolences go out to the victims and their families".

"We stand firmly in solidarity with Indonesia and its people during this difficult time," he wrote. "This is a grim reminder that our region is not spared from the threat of terrorism. We must stay vigilant and united."
