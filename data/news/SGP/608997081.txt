Yvonne Seah, 45, was sentenced to two weeks in prison and a fine of S$10,000 ($6,929), after pleading guilty to three charges including forgery and failure to disclose suspicious transactions involving Malaysian businessman Low Taek Jho.

Singapore authorities have described Low, also known as Jho Low, as a key figure in the money-laundering investigation.

Seah worked with Yak Yew Chee, a senior vice president at BSI Singapore, who was a private banker for Low and 1MDB.

Yak was sentenced to 18-week jail term in November on similar charges.

Founded by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who chaired its advisory board, 1MDB is currently the subject of money laundering investigations in at least six countries, including Switzerland, Singapore and the United States.

Najib has denied any wrongdoing and has said Malaysia will cooperate with the international investigations.

Singapore this year shut down BSI and Falcon Private Bank in its biggest crackdown on alleged money laundering connected to 1MDB.

In May, Singapore’s central bank referred six members of BSI Bank’s senior management and staff to the public prosecutor to check if they had committed criminal offences in the wake of its money-laundering investigation.
