A PERTH man has been sentenced to six-and-a-half months in a Singaporean jail for assaulting airport officers during a two-week drunken binge.

Handcuffed with his feet in chains, Jason Peter Darragh pleaded guilty to four charges, including one count of using criminal force, on Thursday.

The catalogue of misdemeanours began on April 20 at Singapore’s Changi Airport when Darragh assaulted a policeman while on a stopover en route to Cebu, Philippines.

The next day, Darragh was charged with causing “annoyance” to a member of the public at the city-state’s party district and for using “abusive words” to a police officer.



The 44-year-old was finally charged on May 1 with “causing annoyance” to a woman by “loitering” around a taxi stand with his hand over his crotch.

Judge Tan Jen Tse said he had to impose an “appropriate sentence to deter like-minded people from assaulting our police officers”.

Darragh was held in remand since May despite being offered bail of $S20,000 ($A18,647). His lawyer, S.S. Dhillon said he had refused bail to “reflect” on his actions.

Mr Dhillon told the court that Darragh was depressed and turned to alcohol after separating from his wife and two children.

Darragh’s parents had flown from Perth to attend the hearing and were able to speak with him through a window in the court.

They declined to comment outside the court.
