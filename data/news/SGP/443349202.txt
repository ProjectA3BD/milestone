SINGAPORE: A report about an assault at Pasir Ris Street 71 on Sunday night has led to the arrest of three men, aged between 32 and 37, for attempted murder.

While nabbing two of the suspects at an Aloha Changi chalet, police officers also seized items such as a meat mincer, a chainsaw, kitchen knives, a gas cooker, a gas cylinder tank, a tool set, trolley bags, plastic sheets, cable ties, a cleaver, aprons, a chopping board and rubber boots.

In a statement released late on Tuesday night, police said the three suspects will appear in court on Wednesday morning.

On Sunday, at about 9.30pm, a 28-year-old man reported to police that he had been assaulted by two unknown men at the multi-storey carpark at Block 747A Pasir Ris Street 71.

He told police that the two men, together with another unknown man, had fled the scene when his cries for help attracted the attention of passers-by.

Officers ambushed and arrested the first suspect - a 37-year-old man - near Balestier Road on Monday at about 1pm.

After further enquiries, officers mounted an operation and arrested two men, both aged 32, at a chalet at Aloha Changi at about 9.50pm on Monday.

That was when they recovered the chainsaw and meat mincer, among other items.

At about 6.40am on Tuesday, police were alerted to an abandoned vehicle at the basement carpark of Changi Airport Terminal 3.

Officers found a white Mitsubishi multi-purpose vehicle at the carpark, and preliminary investigations suggest that it is linked to the case.

The police are also looking for Myanmar national Aung Aung, 29, to assist in investigations. He is believed to have left Singapore on Tuesday morning.

Anyone with information on Aung Aung can contact the police at 1800-255-0000, or submit the information online at www.police.gov.sg/CrimeStopper. All information will be kept strictly confidential. â€“ The Straits Times/Asia News Network
