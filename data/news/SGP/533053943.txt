Bank Century Case Fugitive Arrested

TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - The National Police has arrested Hartawan Aluwi, a fugitive connected to Bank Century scam, who was deported from Singapore to Soekarno-Hatta Airport.

“Hartawan’s deportation is a result of cooperation between the National Police and the Singaporean authorities,” Boy said in a press conference at the National Police headquarter on Friday, 22 April 2016.

Boy explained that Hartawan had a permanent residence permit in Singapore, although his passport had expired in 2012. Police found out about Hartawan’s presence in Singapore in 2014 and coordinated with the Singaporean authorities to revoke Hartawan’s stay permit.

“The National Police’s Criminal Investigation Corps (Bareskrim) continued to coordinate [with the Singaporean authorities]. Finally, Hartawan’s permanent residence permit was revoked, making him an illegal citizen,” Boy added.

Hartawan was then deported and picked up by two Bareskrim’s investigators at the Singaporean Immigration Office.

Hartawan was sentenced to 14 years in prison for his involvement in the Century scam. He was the owner of PT Antaboga Delta Sekuritas account, which was used to pool money sent by major Bank Century shareholder Robert Tantular. He was charged for causing trillions of rupiah in state losses.
