SINGAPORE, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong condemned the siege of a Kenyan university campus by gunmen which has killed 147 and injured 79 on Thursday as " dastardly act of terror" in a letter to Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday.

Lee said he was "shocked and saddened to learn that many of the 147 victims killed were young university students."

It was the country's deadliest attack since the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings.

The attack was claimed by al-Qaida-linked Al-Shabaab fighters. Four gunmen from the same group carried out the Westgate shopping mall massacre in Nairobi in September 2013, killing at least 67 people in a four-day siege.

"It is a stark reminder of the danger that terrorism poses to societies all over the world," Lee wrote.

He has also offered his deepest condolences to the victims, saying that Singapore's thoughts are with them during this difficult time.
