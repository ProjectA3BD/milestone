SINGAPORE: Singapore has said it “will not hesitate” to investigate and take action against anyone found guilty of flouting recently imposed rules to suspend all trade with North Korea.

Singapore Customs said it adopted several new sanctions in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolutions imposed on North Korea for its repeated nuclear and missile provocations.

The latest move, which took effect on Nov 8, prohibits all commercial imports, exports, transshipment and transit of goods to or from North Korea through Singapore.

Those who break the law can be fined or jailed for up to two years, or both. — The Straits Times/Asia News Network
