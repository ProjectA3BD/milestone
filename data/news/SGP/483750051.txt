In May last year, 27-year-old Namale Allen was severely injured when an unknown man threw acid at her outside her home in Kampala, Uganda.

She was carrying her four-year-old child at the time, who escaped with minor burns. Her attacker has never been caught, nor has a motive been determined.

The charity Upasuaji Africa was set up to draw attention to her plight, and to improve surgical treatment for the people of East Africa.

It says at least 50 acid attack victims are treated every year at Kampala's national hospital, but that there are likely many more cases.

With the help of the charity, Namale Allen travelled to Singapore for surgery. She told the BBC's Charlotte Glennie she wanted to become a voice for victims.
