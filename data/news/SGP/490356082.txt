Singapore police have a further eight weeks to complete their investigation into a Belgian financial executive charged with murdering his five-year-old son, after state prosecutors Wednesday requested more time.

Philippe Graffart, 42, has been charged with murder -- an offence punishable in Singapore by hanging -- for the death of his son, Keryan, at an upmarket condominium in October.

Graffart's lawyer, Ramesh Tiwary, had no objections to the state prosecutors' request during a pre-trial appearance at a district court.

Graffart was arrested before dawn on October 6 after arriving at a police station with self-inflicted wounds and was charged with murder on October 7. He will continue to be held at the central police division until the next pre-trial hearing on January 29.

He was moved from a medical complex at Changi Prison to the central police division near the trial court in late November following more than a month of psychiatric assessment.

Local media reported that Graffart's son was found by police strangled in his bedroom with hand-shaped bruises around the neck. Graffart was believed to be fighting custody for the son with his former wife.

A charge sheet said Graffart "did commit murder by causing the death" of his son at his 32nd floor apartment.

The Belgian's LinkedIn account describes him as an executive director and head of fund distribution in the Asia-Pacific region for Oslo-based Nordea Investment Management.

A Facebook account in his name showed a collection of happy photos with his son Keryan.

"Happy Birthday to you Keryan! 5 years i am so proud of you!," said a post dated September 25.
