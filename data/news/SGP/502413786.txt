An Indian-origin man has been sentenced to seven years in prison and ordered to be given 12 strokes of cane for robbing a money-changer here.

28-year-old Ravi Sandhira Sagaran yesterday pleaded guilty of robbing Ali Yousouf Saiboo, 35, of 6,24,036 Dollars and foreign currencies on November 5, 2014, reported The Straits Times.

Four other accused in the case are still at large.

A second charge was also taken into consideration for conspiring with several men, including one Tachana Moorthy Peromal, 29 and Annadurai Raman, 43, to steal a car from a parking lot.

Tachana and Annadurai would go on trial next month, according to the report.

Sagaran agreed to join them after being promised a share of the loot, Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Soo Tet said.

Sagaran and his accomplices tailed Saiboo's car and blocked it at the parking lot.

Saiboo, whose two-year old son was with him, activated the door locks in his car, but one of the men smashed the car window with a crowbar, while another dragged Saiboo out and assaulted him.

Sagaran was arrested on November 12, 2014 but the money is yet to be recovered.
