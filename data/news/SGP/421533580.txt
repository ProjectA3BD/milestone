SINGAPORE - A 16-year-old was charged in court on Tuesday with uploading online materials intending to wound the religious feelings of Christians and making remarks on Mr Lee Kuan Yew that offended people.

Amos Yee Pang Sang, clad in a black T-shirt and beige pants, faces three charges which were committed last Friday and Saturday.

The teen, who was not represented, allegedly uploaded content online which contained remarks against Christianity with the deliberate intention of wounding the religious feelings of Christians.

He is also said to have transmitted electronically an image showing obscene figures.

The third charge comes under the Protection of Harassment Act. It accuses him of making an online video containing remarks about Mr Lee that offended people who viewed it.

The remarks Yee made in the video included "good riddance" and his hope that the late Mr Lee would not rest in peace.

Yee indicated he wished to engage a lawyer.

Deputy Public Prosecutor Hon Yi asked that Yee, whose $20,000 police bail was extended, not post, upload or otherwise distribute any comment or content, whether directly or indirectly, online while his current case is ongoing.

Mr Hon's application that Yee report daily to the investigation officer was rejected by District Judge John Ng.

The judge asked Yee if he understood that the only additional condition he imposed was not to post or distribute anything online. Yee replied: "Yes, Sir."

A pre-trial conference has been fixed for April 17.

Yee was arrested on Sunday. More than 20 police reports were lodged against him for the video and the obscene material he posted on his blog that day.

His father told reporters that he would like to take this opportunity to say "very sorry" to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.
