SINGAPORE， June 13 (Xinhua) -- Singaporean leaders early Monday expressed condolences over the U.S. Orlando nightclub shooting， in which at least 50 people were killed.

Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean， who is Acting Prime Minister when Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is on leave this week， said he was "saddened by the loss of lives in the attack."

Teo wrote in his Facebook post that "our thoughts are with those who have lost loved ones， and to those who are suffering from the trauma of the shooting."

He also called on Singaporeans to treasure the peace and harmony in the country and focus on the common humanity， rather than allow those with bad motives to divide Singaporeans or create conflicts.

Singapore's President Tony Tan Keng Yam， who is on the way back to Singapore from a visit， also expressed his condolences.

Tony Tan said he was "saddened by the loss of so many innocent lives." "Any act of terror is senseless and should be condemned in the strongest terms，" the president wrote in his Facebook post.

Singapore's Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan also felt saddened by "the senseless and tragic shootings at Orlando，" saying "our deepest condolences and prayers for the victims and their families."

The Islamic State-linked news agency Amaq said on Sunday that the militant group claimed responsibility for the mass shooting that occurred earlier in the day at a gay nightclub in Orlando， Florida.

It is the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.

U.S. President Barack Obama on Sunday called the shooting an "act of terror" and "act of hate."
