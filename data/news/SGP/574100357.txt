Zaman Daulat and Mamum Liakot Ali, who had previously denied the charges against them under the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act (TSOFA), pleaded guilty bringing the number of those convicted on similar charges to six, Xinhua news agency reported.

The two men were included in the group comprising of eight radicalised male Bangladeshi workers, who planned to overthrow the Bangladeshi government by force and establish an Islamic state in Bangladesh.

Four members of the group in May pleaded guilty in Singapore to one or two counts each of providing or collecting hundreds of dollars to fund terror attacks.

The four men were sentenced to between 24 and 60 months in jail.
