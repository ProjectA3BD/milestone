SINGAPORE, Sept. 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Minister for Trade and Industry S. Iswaran on Wednesday launched the Electronics Industry Transformation Map, which maps out strategies that will build the electronics industry of tomorrow, according to a press release from Singapore Economic Development Board.

The Map says Singapore's electronics industry is expected to achieve a manufacturing value-add of 22.2 billion Singapore dollars (about 16.52 billion U.S. dollars) and introduce 2,100 new professional, managerial, executive and technical jobs by 2020.

It says Singapore will transform the electronics industry to attract and anchor high value-added manufacturing activities, boost productivity through the adoption of robotics and automation, and support companies to undertake advanced manufacturing innovation.

The country will convene multi-party innovation platforms to create new solutions and shorten innovation cycles, and become an innovation hub for new products and solutions.

Besides, the Map says Singapore will develop a Skills Framework for continuous learning to nurture a nimble and dynamic workforce, and equip Singaporeans with necessary skills to capture new opportunities.
