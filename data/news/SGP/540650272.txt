Update 05/20/2016: On May 20, 2016, Singaporean authorities executed Kho Jabing, less than three hours after the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal petition. Koh’s execution reflects Singapore’s disregard for the right to life and for the growing worldwide movement to do away with the death penalty, Human Rights Watch said.

Update 05/19/2016: On May 19, Singapore’s judicial commissioner allowed Kho Jabing a temporary stay of execution while an issue regarding judicial bias was being appealed. Kho Jabing remains at imminent risk of execution.

(Bangkok) – Singapore President Tony Tan should urgently grant clemency to death row prisoner Kho Jabing, who is due to be executed on May 20, Human Rights Watch said today. Jabing was convicted of the murder of Cao Ruyin in 2007.
