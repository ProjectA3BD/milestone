Last month, Yee pleaded guilty to three charges of wounding Muslim and Christian feelings and two charges for failing to show up at a police station. During his trial, the court heard that 24 police reports had been lodged against him, in relation to the total of six counts he faces for wounding religious feelings.

Yee left Singapore on Dec 13 last year, after he was served a notice requiring him to attend a police interview two days later. He travelled to Hong Kong, where he published several posts about being served the notice.

After he returned in April this year, the police served another notice on Yee. He tried to leave the country the day before the interview and was arrested on May 11.

The blogger was convicted of similar charges last year and sentenced to four weeks' jail.
