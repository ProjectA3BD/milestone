"FINMA recently discontinued its investigation into UBS. FINMA found no systematic, serious misconduct, but sent the bank a written reprimand," FINMA said in a statement following its annual media conference.

In October, UBS was fined 1.3 million Singapore dollars ($930,000) by Singapore's central bank for breaches in Singapore's anti-money laundering law.
