SINGAPORE: A Malaysian man who raped a 12-year-old schoolgirl in 2002 was caught by chance when he was arrested and investigated for an unrelated theft in 2014, The Straits Times reported.

The news report on Wednesday said he pleaded guilty to rape and was sentenced to 16-and-a-half years in jail and 18 strokes of the cane.

The High Court heard that carpenter Lee Ah Choy, now 37, has a wife and a 10-year-old son living in Johor Baru.

They did not know about the offence, committed when he was 23 years old, the report said.

The report added Lee was working in Singapore in 2002 and 12 years later, he was arrested and investigated for theft and his DNA profile matched that of the rapist.

Besides rape, Lee also pleaded guilty to aggravated outrage of modesty and criminal intimidation.

A fourth charge of abduction was taken into consideration during sentencing.

Lee's jail term was backdated to Jan 23 last year, when he was remanded.

For raping a minor under 14 years of age, he could have been jailed up to 20 years, and punished with at least 12 strokes of the cane, said the report. â€“ Bernama
