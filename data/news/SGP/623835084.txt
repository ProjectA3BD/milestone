A Saudi diplomat has been sentenced to be caned in Singapore for sexually assaulting a hotel worker while on holiday with his family.

Bander Yahya A Alzahrani was also sentenced to more than two years in jail after being convicted of 'outraging modesty' by molesting the young intern.

The Beijing-based 39-year-old was granted bail for Sg$20,000 (£11,350) and will be appealing the sentence and conviction, his lawyer Shashi Nathan said.

'He's obviously upset and disappointed, but he understands there's another stage of the appeal to be had, and that's what we will be preparing for,' Nathan said.

The victim had initially refused to report the incident but staff members at the hotel later convinced her to contact police after they found out that she had been molested in Alzahrani's room, court papers showed.

The diplomat, who handled media affairs at the Saudi mission in the Chinese capital, was in Singapore on holiday with his family.

However, he was alone in the room with the victim during the incident.

Alzahrani had said in his defence that the victim was conspiring with hotel staff to extort money from him, an allegation which the judge dismissed.

'The accused preyed on a young, naive victim,' said district judge Lee Poh Choo. 'He knew and intended his actions.'
