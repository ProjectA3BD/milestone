PETALING JAYA: The family of Kho Jabing are anxiously waiting to see if the Singapore Court of Appeal will decide if he will be executed or have his sentence commuted for a murder he committed eight years ago.

His mother Lenduk Baling and his sister Jumai Kho arrived in Singapore on Sunday from Sarawak for the judgement, which is likely to be delivered on Tuesday.

"We are very anxious. We can only hope for the best," Jumai told The Star Online in a phone interview on Monday.

Kho Jabing, 31, who is from Ulu Baram, Sarawak faces the gallows for killing a Chinese construction worker with a tree branch back in 2008 during a robbery attempt.

He was scheduled to be executed on Nov 6 last year, but received a stay after his lawyer filed a motion raising points of law about the way the case was handled.

Jumai said she and her mother had met Jabing earlier on Monday, who also hoped for his death sentence to be commuted.

Jabing was sentenced to death in 2010, but following revisions to Singapore's mandatory death penalty laws in August 2013, Singpore's high court sentenced him to life imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane instead.

The prosecution challenged the decision before the court of appeal, which reinstated Jabing death sentence in a 3-2 majority decision earlier last year.

On Oct 19, Singapore president Tony Tan rejected a clemency petition before a stay of execution by the court of appeal.

In 2013, the Singapore government abolished the mandatory death penalty and gave judges discretion to choose between a death sentence or life imprisonment with caning in murder and certain drug trafficking cases.
