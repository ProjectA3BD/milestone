SINGAPORE, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- Singapore "strongly condemns" the car bomb attack targeting the Turkish military in the capital of Ankara, which at least 28 people were killed and 61 others wounded, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) on Thursday.

"MFA strongly condemns the car bomb attack in central Ankara which has resulted in the loss of many lives with dozens more injured. We extend our condolences to the bereaved families and wish those injured a speedy recovery," the ministry said in a press release.
