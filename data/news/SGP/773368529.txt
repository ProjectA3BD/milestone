Ng, director of OCN Singapore and said to be director of sister company T Specialist, had denied last year that he ran high-end retail stores in the reclusive country.

He also denied stocking them with banned luxury goods.

The multiple charges Ng were slapped with include abetting by engaging in a conspiracy with T Specialist International, along with two people Sherly Muliawan and Li Ik, to supply luxury items to a person in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in 2011.

T Specialist International faces 88 charges and the case will be heard next month.



In one of the 161 charges, Ng was accused of allegedly abetting wholesale trade company T Specialist in supplying perfumes and cosmetics worth more than S$38,000 to a shop in North Korea.



This is a breach of regulations under the United Nations Act, for which Ng can be fined up to S$100,000 and jailed for up to five years.



Ng was also charged with abetting by engaging in a conspiracy with an accomplice Wang Zhi Guo in order to cheat banks including CIMB Bank Berhad and DBS Bank.



One charge involves the issuing of a false invoice for the US$1,825,740 (S$2,497,044) sale of a product "Watari Instant Noodle", which led to CIMB Bank Berhad making payment in that amount to another company, Pinnacle Offshore Trading.

For cheating and dishonestly inducing a delivery of property, he can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined.

Ng is out on bail of S$500,000 and will be back in court next month.
