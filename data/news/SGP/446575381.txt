Bangkok: A 16-year-old blogger was sentenced to four weeks in prison in Singapore for posting offensive videos on YouTube in a trial that attracted much criticism from human rights organisations.

Amos Yee was found guilty of insulting Christianity and uploading obscene images.

The court dismissed a second charge against the teenager, of criticising former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew who passed away in March, reported Channel News Asia.

Yee's lawyer Alfred Dodwell said they would appeal the verdict as his client was innocent.

Yee, whose videos have already got over half a million hits, was admitted to the Institute of Mental Health for psychiatric examinations and spent 50 days in custody before the trial.

Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch (HRW) slammed Singaporean authorities for violation of Yee's right to freedom of expression.

"The authorities have seriously abused his rights for simply voicing political opinions unpopular with the government," said Phil Robertson, deputy director of the Asia chapter of HRW.

Robertson further said the action against Amos Yee was an "injustice", and called for the teenager's unconditional release.
