SINGAPORE: Fifteen months after he was given a prison sentence for wounding religious feelings, Singaporean blogger Amos Yee (pic) on Thursday was again given a jail term for the same crime.

The 17-year-old was sentenced to six weeks' jail and a $2,000 fine in total for his eight charges - two for failing to turn up at a police station and six for wounding Muslim and/or Christian feelings.

Principal District Judge Ong Hian Sun said Yee's "contemptuous and irreverent remarks" have the tendency to generate unrest, crest animosity and undermine social harmony.

If Yee does not pay the fine, he will have to spend another 10 days in jail. He will start his sentence on Oct 13.

Deputy Public Prosecutor Hon Yi said: "This case is about an accused person who, even after a previous brush with the law for a similar offence, deliberately upped the ante by escalating the offensiveness of the material which he created. The accused cynically set out to wound religious feelings in order to gain attention for himself, and ultimately to profit financially from such attention.

"Though the accused is young, he is not immature, and he knows full well the implications of his action. A viewing of his videos, laden with strong language and rife with comments aimed at insulting key aspects of the Christian and Muslim faiths, easily bears this out. In sentencing the accused, this court should send a clear message that acts which impugn the racial and religious harmony of this country will not be tolerated," DPP Hon added.

Defence lawyer N. Kanagavijayan said Yee is "deeply remorseful for all his acts".

"He admits that all his acts were grossly offensive and provocative to the Christian faith and to Islam. He admits that his acts were premeditated." â€“ The Straits Times/Asia News Network
