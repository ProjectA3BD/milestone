SINGAPORE, Aug 8 — A Malaysian man who helped an individual nicknamed ‘One-Eyed Dragon’ to flee Singapore after the latter had shot dead a nightclub owner, pleaded guilty today to harbouring an offender, Channel NewsAsia reported.

The news portal reported that Ho Yueh Keong’s plea of guilt came more than 10 years after he had driven Tan Chot Jin across the border on Feb 15, 2006, shortly after Tan had murdered Lim Hock Soon.

According to the report, Tan was sentenced to death in 2007 and executed two years later after his appeal was dismissed by the apex court, followed by a denial of his clemency application.

On Monday, a District Court heard that Ho had driven Tan to Singapore on Feb 14, 2006 — a day before the killing — and an arrest warrant for Ho was issued on Feb 16.

The report said that although Ho had wanted to surrender, Tan persuaded him otherwise.

It added that after nine years on the run, Ho was arrested in Malaysia and brought back to Singapore on July 13, last year.

The report said that Ho’s case would next be mentioned on Wednesday.

He faces up to five years’ jail and a fine for harbouring an offender knowing that he (offender) had committed murder.

A second charge of intentionally omitting to give information on the offence, despite being legally bound to do so, would be taken into consideration when Ho was sentenced, said the report. — Bernama
