CHENNAI: Portrait and fashion photographer Sam Kumar combined his two interests — dance and nature — to bring out a series of photographs. Through the ‘Environmental Dance’ project conceived by him, he has captured dancers in graceful movements, in outdoor and urban locations.

The message conveyed by the project, according to Sam, is to protect the natural environment. The photos have been clicked in places, away from the comfort zone of the dance stage, where the dancer is made to react to the natural outdoor environment. All the dancers confided that dancing outdoors was an amazing and a deeply satisfying experience, according to the photographer.

The exhibition includes 30 photographs of dancers Nanditha Prabhu, Kalpana Sivaramakrishnan, Achuta Manasa and International dancers Mio Ikeda (Japan), Marianne Verhaagen (Holland), Beverly Yuen (Singapore), Vivian (Singapore), Pon (Thailand) and Courtney Ramm (US). The images were captured in India, Singapore, Bali and Thailand between 2010 and 2014. After its world premiere at Pai in Thailand in October 2014, Chennai is the second venue where the exhibtion is being showcased. The show is set to travel to Singapore, Japan, Holland, France, Canada and the US.

The exhibition Environmental Dance will be on at Art Houz Gallery till January 14.
