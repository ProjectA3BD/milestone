Twenty six suspected drug traffickers and 55 suspected drug abusers were arrested during an intensive three-day island-wide operation by Singapore's Central Bureau, an official release said on Thursday.

During the operation, CNB seized about three kilogrammes of heroin, 495 grams of "Ice", 42 grams of cannabis and some other drugs such as "Ecstasy" tablets and Erimin-5 tablets, which are estimated to be worth more than 314,000 dollars (US $222,695), Xinhua reported.

Investigations into the drug activities of all the arrested people are underway.

The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine (or pure heroin) trafficked exceeds 15 grams, and if the amount of methamphetamine trafficked exceeds 250 grams, CNB added.
