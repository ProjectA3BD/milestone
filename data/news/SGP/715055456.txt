Bangkok: Myanmar's government has charged two Reuters journalists who had been leaked documents on brutal military-led attacks on Rohingya Muslims in the country's Rakhine State.

Reuters said it was "outraged" by the arrests of Wa Lone, 31 and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, who have been held under the country's draconian Official Secrets Act that carries penalties of up to 14 years jail.

"The two journalists obtained the documents by deception from the two policemen who came back from Rakhine state after serving security duties," Myanmar police said in a statement.

The United States embassy in Myanmar said it was "deeply concerned" about the arrests and urged the government to allow access to the pair.
