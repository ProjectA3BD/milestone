SINGAPORE - The suspect who allegedly snatched a police officer's revolver and opened fire at a hospital in Singapore on June 20 is facing two additional charges, local media reported on Monday.

The suspect, Muhammad Iskandar Sa'at, faced an additional charge of voluntarily causing hurt to Staff Sergeant Mohammad Sadli Bin Razali, who has suffered gunshot wounds. Muhammad Iskandar allegedly hit the police officer multiple times with a metal pole. He also faced another charge of resistance to lawful apprehension by attempting to escape from the police officer's custody.

Muhammad Iskandar was charged for unlawful discharge of firearms at the State Courts on June 22. The charge still stands, which means he still could face the death penalty if he is convicted under the Arms Offenses Act.

As the suspect faced a capital charge, no bail was offered. The prosecution asked for the accused to be remanded for three weeks at Changi Prison Complex Medical Center to undergo psychiatric assessment, and the case will be heard on July 20.

Muhammad Iskandar was arrested for motor vehicle theft on June 19 and was brought to the hospital after complaining of chest pains the next day. While inside one of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital's examination rooms, he attempted to escape but was stopped by one of the police officers. The suspect snatched the police officer's revolver during the struggle, then the situation was brought under control swiftly by the police.
