Man Arrested For Importation Of Counterfeit Bags For The Purpose Of Trade

A 43-year-old man has been arrested following a six-hour operation for his suspected involvement in the importation of counterfeit bags for the purpose of trade.

On 18 September 2017, Singapore Customs inspected a consignment suspected to contain trademark-infringing goods. A total of 200 bags and luggage were detained after the brand owners confirmed that they were counterfeit. Singapore Customs referred the matter to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) for follow-up.

On receipt of the information, officers from CID conducted extensive enquiries over several days. On 26 September 2017, officers from CID and Singapore Customs conducted raids at a warehouse in Jurong Port Road as well as a residential unit in Punggol, resulting in the arrest of the suspect.

A total of 318 counterfeit bags with an estimated street value of S$11,680 were seized in this case.

Investigations are ongoing.

The authorities take a serious view on intellectual property right (IPR) infringements and will not hesitate to take action against perpetrators who showed blatant disregard for Singaporeâ€™s IPR laws.

Persons found guilty of importing, possessing or distributing goods with falsely applied trade mark for the purpose of trade may be sentenced up to a maximum fine of $100,000, or an imprisonment term of up to five years, or both.
