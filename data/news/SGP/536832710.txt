Singapore says it has arrested eight Bangladeshi men accused of plotting terror attacks in Bangladesh.

Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs said they were members of a group set up in March called Islamic State in Bangladesh (ISB).

The men, aged 26 to 34, had been working in the construction and marine industries.

Singapore is increasingly concerned about the spread of militant jihadism in neighbouring countries.

In January, it arrested 27 Bangladeshi workers - deporting 26 - accused of supporting militant Islam.

The ministry said the eight men held in April had intended to join the so-called Islamic State militant group.

But after deciding it would be too hard to travel to Syria they instead planned to return to Bangladesh to overthrow the government and had "identified several possible attack targets".

Money, bomb-making instructions and extremist recruitment material was seized from the men, officials added.

There was no indication of plans to target Singapore, said the statement.
