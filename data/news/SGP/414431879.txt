SINGAPORE - Four people believed to be part of an online vice ring were charged for offences under the Women's Charter on Thursday.

The suspects are a 20-year-old Vietnamese woman and three Singaporean men aged 27 to 51.

Two of the men, Tan Teck Seng and Kelvin Lim Qi Xian, both 27, were charged with knowingly living off the earnings of a 22 year-old Vietnamese prostitute.

The other two suspects, Tan Tian Sze, 51, and Luong Thi Thu Ngan, 20, were charged with receiving the same woman into Singapore on Monday, knowing that she had been procured for the purpose of prostitution within the country.

The case will be mentioned in court again on March 26, after the police asked for further investigations to be conducted and more charges to be filed.

The suspects were arrested on Tuesday in an islandwide blitz against a vice syndicate believed to have advertised sexual services online.

A total of 24 people were nabbed by Criminal Investigation Department officers in the crackdown in areas such as Geylang, Hougang, Bishan and Jurong West.

Cash amounting to about $270,000 was seized, along with computers and cell phones.

Investigations are ongoing against the remaining three men and 17 women arrested, aged 19 to 64.

If convicted of their respective offences, the four who have been charged each faces up to five years in jail and a fine of up to $10,000.
