SINGAPORE, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Singaporean police have arrested four teenage boys who are suspected of involving in a case of sharing-bike abuse near a mass rapid transit (MRT) station and a bus interchange, the Straits Times reported on Tuesday.

The teenagers, aged from 16 to 18, were arrested for committing a rash act and public nuisance on Monday, police said.

A snapchat clip recently circulated on social media showed a shirtless man hurling an oBike sharing-bike into a canal. He was then filmed riding around a MRT station and near a bus interchange, on an Ofo sharing-bike.

If convicted of committing a rash act, the suspects can be jailed up to six months and fined up to 2,500 Singapore dollars (about 1,800.75 U.S. dollars). If convicted of public nuisance, the penalty is a fine of up to 1,000 Singapore dollars (about 720.3 U.S. dollars).

The Straits Times reported last week that a 14-year-old boy who allegedly threw an Ofo sharing-bike down from the 30th level of the building he lives in was arrested. A 13-second video showing his act was also circulated on social media.

By now, three companies - oBike, Ofo and Mobike - have launched dock-less bike-sharing business in Singapore.
