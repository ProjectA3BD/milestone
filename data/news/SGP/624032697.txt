A Beijing-based Saudi diplomat was sentenced in Singapore on Friday to more than two years in jail and four strokes of a cane for molesting a hotel intern.

Bander Yahya A. Alzahrani (39) was sentenced to 26 months and one week in prison after being convicted of “outraging modesty”, the legal term in Singapore for sexual assault short of rape.

Given bail

Alzahrani was granted bail for Sg$20,000 ($14,140) and will be appealing the sentence and conviction, said his lawyer Shashi Nathan.

The diplomat, who handled media affairs at the Saudi mission in the Chinese capital, was in Singapore on holiday with his family. However, he was alone in the room with the victim during the incident. “Outraging the modesty” is punishable by up to 10 years in jail and whipping with a rattan cane, a punishment which dates back to British colonial rule in Singapore. — AFP
