The organising board presented 10 A prizes and 20 B prizes to outstanding dance performances, along with prizes to the best three dancers and the most excellent young artist.

The week-long festival brought together 300 artists from 14 foreign countries including Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, Colombia, Singapore, Egypt, Japan, Indonesia, China, Bangladesh, Russia and Malaysia. Host Vietnam sent 200 artists to the event.

The art troupes presented 80 well-prepared dance performances, helping audiences understand more about the cultures of participating countries and localities.

The dances will be also performed in other localities like Hanoi and Thanh Hoa province.

The festival was one of the biggest cultural events during the year which aimed to foster cooperation in culture and arts between Vietnam and other countries.

It also offered a chance for Vietnam to introduce the images of its land, people and culture to international friends.
