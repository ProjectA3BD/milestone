JOHOR BARU: The Immigration Department is stepping up enforcement to curb people crossing into Singapore from Malaysia through rat lanes.



Its director-general, Datuk Mustafa Ibrahim said the department had detected people using short-cuts across the Johor Baru-Singapore railways tracks to go to work and raids were conducted to stop the people from doing so.



"What we are doing now is to take preventive measures to educate the public, but stern action will be taken after this," he told reporters after a programme to inculcate noble values and distribution of food for breaking of fast at the bus lane of the Customs, Immigration and Quarantine Complex, Sultan Iskandar Building here last night.



He said the department had detained 54 individuals who were caught sneaking out to Singapore in several raids conducted, including three people two days ago.



"We will discuss this problem with the National Security council and also to close the rat lanes," he added. â€“ Bernama
