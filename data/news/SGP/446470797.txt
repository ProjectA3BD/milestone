The sentences were backdated to June 2, when Yee was already in remand after violating probation terms.

Singapore — The Singaporean teenager behind online attacks on former premier Lee Kuan Yew was given a four-week jail sentence on Monday but freed in view of time served since being accused of offending and posting an obscene image.

Amos Yee, 16, was jailed for three weeks for wounding religious feelings in an expletive-laden YouTube video comparing Lee Kuan Yew to Jesus, which was posted after the independence leader’s death in March.

He also received a one-week jail term for posting an obscene drawing of Lee and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

The sentences were backdated to June 2, when Yee was already in remand after violating probation terms.

District Court judge Jasvender Kaur said the offences “were not serious in nature but not trivial either”.

Yee had faced an extended period behind bars.
