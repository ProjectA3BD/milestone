SINGAPORE: The police are investigating a 33-year-old man for lodging a false police report claiming he was robbed.

He claimed the assailants took his wallet containing S$400 in cash before fleeing.

However, the police found inconsistencies in his statement, and after investigating, discovered that he had not been robbed and had provided false information.



Investigations against the man are ongoing. Anyone convicted for giving information which he knows to be false to a public servant could face a jail term of up to a year, or a fine of up to S$5,000, or both.

"The police would like to remind the public that police resources could have been put to better use in dealing with real crimes and emergencies than investigating into false reports or false information," the police said.
