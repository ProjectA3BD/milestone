SINGAPORE: A staring incident involving two drunk men may have prompted an attack which was caught on a video which went viral.

The footage shows one man repeatedly stomping on his victim who was lying motionless on the ground in a mall.

Following the attack, police said they arrested a 22-year-old Singaporean male suspect on Saturday (Oct 14) night. The incident has been classified as voluntarily causing grievous hurt.

In a statement, police said the incident took place at Golden Mile complex on Wednesday (Oct 11) at about 3am.

The Singapore Civil Defence Force said the man was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital by ambulance. He was conscious and is believed to have sustained severe facial injuries.

The Straits Times understands that the suspect was there for supper with a friend, and the altercation erupted outside a toilet after a staring incident.

The video does not reveal how the 25-year-old male Singaporean victim ended up being floored but shows a man repeatedly stomping on his head outside a shuttered shop.

He then approaches another man in black, said to be the victim's friend, and punches him.

Bystanders can be heard exclaiming when the attacker returns and stomps on the first man a few more times. The suspect then left in a taxi.

The victim has since been discharged from the hospital.

On Sunday afternoon (Oct 15), the suspect was taken back to the scene wearing restraints.

Police said he will be charged on Monday (Oct 16). - The Straits Times/Asia News Network
