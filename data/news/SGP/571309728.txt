PRIME Minister Lee Hsien Loong tackled the issue of terrorism at the National Day Rally on Sunday, saying that Singapore has quietly acted on information about other planned attacks by terrorists.

Earlier this month, Indonesian police arrested six militants in Batam. Their leader, Gigih Rahmat Dewa, had been planning a rocket attack on Marina Bay Sands (MBS).

"Gigih's plot to attack MBS is not the only definite plan by terrorists to attack targets in Singapore, that we know of. We know of others," said Mr Lee.

"We have quietly acted on the information, and taken precautions."

These precautions include stepping up patrols and raising protection for major events and for prominent areas.

"Sometimes we have shifted and rescheduled events because of these threats," Mr Lee said.

The prime minister pointed out that in Singapore, the threat is not just external, but also domestic.

"Singaporeans are not entirely immune to jihadist propaganda," Mr Lee said.

The prime minister also stressed the need for Singapore to be prepared before an attack, and for Singaporeans to stand with each other.

"We all have to do our part," he said.
