PETALING JAYA: A Malaysian who was scheduled to be hanged in Singapore today for committing a murder in 2008 has been granted a stay of the execution.

The republic’s Court of Appeal granted the stay yesterday to Sarawakian Kho Jabing, 31.

According to anti-death penalty advocacy group We Believe in Second Chances, Jabing’s lawyer filed a motion on Wednesday, rai­sing points of law about the way the case was handled.

“The court allowed the stay as it needed time to review all the documents and papers and to make his arguments more fully,” We Believe in Second Chances founding member Kirsten Hans told The Star.

She said no date was set to hear the case.

Jabing was convicted of killing a Chinese construction worker with a tree branch while robbing him.

He was sentenced to death in 2010 but in August 2013, following revisions to Singapore’s mandatory death penalty laws, the High Court sentenced him to life and 24 strokes of the cane instead.

The prosecution challenged the decision last year before the Court of Appeal, which again sentenced Jabing to death.
