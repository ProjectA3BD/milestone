A Bangladeshi man has been sentenced to 11 years’ jail and nine strokes of the cane in Singapore for the rape of a Chinese tourist, reports Channel NewsAsia.

A Singapore court announced the order on Wednesday.

According to the report, the victim, a Chinese woman, was visiting her husband, an expatriate worker, in Geylang, a township in Singapore, when she was set upon by their co-tenant Anowar.

She thought Anowar wanted some toothpaste, so went into the common toilet to get some. Anowar followed her in and locked the door before he grabbed her, pulled her shorts and panties off, and raped her.

“He exploited the victim’s generosity and neighbourliness, and attacked her after she tried to offer assistance to him,” the prosecutor said.

When Anowar unlocked the door and the woman tried to escape, he grabbed her and pulled her back into her room, where he raped her again.

Anowar was arrested the same night.

Anowar initially claimed he had paid her for sex but confessed following the victim’s cross-examination.

The victim said she was traumatised by the incident, becoming withdrawn and insecure. After returning home to China, she installed cameras around her home.

The rape has also damaged her marriage, the woman said. She said her husband asked her why she did not fight harder and believes he blames her for the incident.

The husband said he knows he should support his wife and that questioning her is wrong, but admitted to feeling ‘kind of disgusted’ when they are intimate.
