SINGAPORE - A man has been arrested for pretending to be a police officer and theft.

The 36-year-old allegedly carried out his illegal activities at Housing Board estates in Sims Drive, Geylang East and Aljunied Crescent.

Since October last year, the police have received several reports of a man acting as a plainclothes policeman and committing theft from the victims checked. Cash, jewellery and handphones amounting to more than $2,500 in total were stolen.

In most of the cases, the suspect approached female victims in isolated locations and identified himself as a police officer, flashing a card with his picture and a police logo. He would then check on the unsuspecting victims' belongings before stealing their valuables.

The suspect was arrested on Monday in the vicinity of Merpati Road. If convicted, he could face up to five years in jail and fined.
