SINGAPORE - The first combined annual report by the Media Development Authority's (MDA) four Programme Advisory Committees (PACs) lauded improvements in the production quality of Public Service Broadcast (PSB) programmes.

The PACs said there was use of innovative concepts and a greater variety of programmes, especially shows for children and youths.

In a press release on Monday, the report also commended programmes showcasing local heritage, arts and inspirational real-life accounts.

Fifty PSB programmes made it into the inaugural ‘PAC Choice’ list.

One is Chinese-language cultural travelogue series, The Place We Live In, which was also nominated for best infotainment programme at the Asian Television Awards last year.

Suria’s info-educational series Follow Fasha was chosen for presenting educational elements in dramatised segments; and Vasantham’s Kalaimanigal (Doyens of Art) for its research on Singapore Cultural Medallion winners.

The Food Detectives on Channel 5 was highlighted by the members as a show that provided a fresh take on the familiar topic of food by exploring the facts and myths behind what we consume.

The PAC members encouraged broadcasters to further diversify their offerings. They recommended strengthening niche programmes, such as those for the elderly, and in sports.

Broadcasters should also offer in-depth and timely analyses in current affairs, and boost talent development in the industry, the committee members said.

To commemorate Singapore's 50th birthday, members proposed more programmes promoting social integration and celebrating Singapore's diverse social fabric.

The report also pointed out infractions in broadcast content and standards.

The PAC highlighted misleading claims in radio advertisements and sponsored radio segments that were not clearly identified.

The PACs also observed that several programmes on the free-to-air vernacular channels featured an excessive use of English.
