– Six Islamic militants accused of plotting to fire a rocket at downtown Singapore from an Indonesian island were sentenced to three to four years in prison on June 7 on charges of harbouring and training extremists.Gigih Rahmad Dewa, the group’s leader, were jailed for four years while the five others were each given a three-year jail term.Judge Tarigan Mudalimbong said that there was not enough evidence to prove the rocket plot. However, the court found the militants guilty of concealing two Chinese Uighurs who tried to join an extremist group in Poso on Indonesia’s Sulawesi island and building jihadi training camp, 25 kilometres southeast of Singapore.The men pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (IS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, he added.Last year, those men were arrested on Indonesia’s Batam island. Messages between the group and Indonesian militants Bahrun Naim, who had close link to IS activities, showed that the group plan to fire a rocket to Singapore.Bahrun Naim involved in a suicide bombing in Jakarta on May 24 that killed three police officers.-VNA
