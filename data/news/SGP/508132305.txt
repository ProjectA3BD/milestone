The potential duty and Goods and Services Tax evaded amounted to about S$523,800 and S$49,990, respectively, says the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority.

SINGAPORE: A total of 6,750 cartons of duty-unpaid cigarettes were found hidden in a Malaysia-registered truck conveying a 40-footer container early Wednesday morning (Feb 3), the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA).

At about 1.20am on Wednesday, ICA officers at the Tuas checkpoint stopped the truck, driven by a 44-year-old male Malaysian, for routine checks. During the inspection, officers found the cartons of cigarettes hidden among consignments of assorted items such as foodstuff and plasticware.

The potential duty and Goods and Services Tax evaded amounted to about S$523,800 and S$49,990, respectively, said ICA. The vehicle, contraband cigarettes and the driver have been handed over to Singapore Customs for investigations.

“The ICA will continue to conduct security checks on passengers and vehicles at the checkpoints to prevent attempts to smuggle in undesirable persons, drugs, weapons, explosives and other contrabands. The same methods of concealment used by contraband smugglers may be used by terrorists to smuggle arms and explosives to carry out attacks in Singapore,” ICA said.
