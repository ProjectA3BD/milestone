SINGAPORE, Sept. 7 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) has seized 4,050 cartons of duty- unpaid cigarettes as well as 150 kg of duty-unpaid unmanufactured tobacco in a Malaysia-registered vehicle last Saturday, ICA said in a press release on Monday.

According to ICA, the Malaysia-registered prime mover, driven by a 42-year-old male Malaysian, was directed for checks at Tuas checkpoint. While it declared to be carrying a consignment of "662 boxes of electrolytic capacitors," ICA officers uncovered a total of 4,050 cartons of duty-unpaid cigarettes as well as 150 bundles each containing about 1 kg of duty-unpaid unmanufactured tobacco, hidden amongst the consignment, with the total value up to over 419,000 Singapore dollars.

The Malaysian, the contraband items and the vehicle were handed over to Singapore Customs for further investigations, ICA said, adding that the vehicle used is liable to be forfeited.

ICA said it will continue to conduct security checks on passengers and vehicles at the checkpoints to prevent attempts to smuggle in undesirable persons, drugs, weapons, explosives and other contrabands. It also stressed that the same methods of concealment used by contraband smugglers may be used by terrorists to smuggle arms and explosives to carry out attacks in Singapore.
