SINGAPORE: A 16-year-old Singaporean boy was remanded to the Institute of Mental Health for two weeks following a conviction on charges of wounding religious feelings and distributing an obscene image.

Amos Yee, who appeared in court in prison garb and shackles, will undergo psychological assessment after authorities said he was diagnosed "on the autism spectrum."

Yee was arrested in March after publishing a YouTube video entitled "Lee Kuan Yew Is Finally Dead!" in which he criticised the modern nation-state's late founder, as well as the Christian faith.

Yee's conviction was criticised by international human rights groups.

"OHCHR is concerned that the criminal sanctions considered in this case seem disproportionate and inappropriate in terms of the international protections for freedom of expression and opinion," the UN's Office of the High Commissioner for Rights Office said. â€“ dpa
