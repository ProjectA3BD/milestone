Sari Gujang attacked his friend with a 30cm-long knife in a drug-fuelled rage, damaging the nerves in his victim's palm.

SINGAPORE: High on drugs and in a rage, Sari Gujang attacked his friend with a 30cm-long knife. The unemployed 27-year-old will now spend 20 months in prison, after pleading guilty to one count of voluntarily causing hurt by a knife and one count of drug consumption. Another two charges for causing hurt were taken into consideration during his sentencing.

The court heard that in the early hours of Jul 21 this year, under the influence of drugs, Sari had “started dredging up past grievances” with when hanging out with two friends at Bedok North. He then punched Zaifudin Zainidun and slashed the 20-year-old's ankle with a Swiss Army knife before leaving on his motorcycle.

After Sari left, Zaifudin and Muhammad Rizuwan Zakariah, 26, continued to hang out at the coffeeshop at Block 537 Bedok North Street 3. About an hour later at around 5am, Sari rejoined them, shouting aggressively.

He then reached behind his back and pulled out a knife, slashing Rizuwan on his bicep and palm. Rizuwan, bleeding profusely, ran to a nearby market to seek help.

The slashing ruptured muscles in three of his fingers, and the tips of all five fingers on his left hand can no longer feel sensation, according to a medical report.

Rizuwan underwent surgery but doctors have said he will never regain full strength and control of his left palm, as the knife had cut through some nerves.

Sari walked away after the attack, but not before telling two passersby not to go to the coffeeshop as he had just slashed someone there. He also told them: “The hand, finished (sic)”, referring to Rizuwan’s injury, and showing them the bloodstained knife.
