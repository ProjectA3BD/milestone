Singapore has imprisoned four Bangladeshi workers for their role in financing terrorist activities in their homeland.

Prosecutors said Tuesday the four had been active in raising money to fund attacks by the Daesh Takfiri terrorist group in Bangladesh.

The court said the men had pleaded guilty and were given jail terms up to five years. It said they were arrested in April and their detention without trial came under Singapore’s Internal Security Act, which allows such cases for the sake of public safety.

Prosecutors said the four Bangladeshis used part of their salary, which ranged from 60 Singapore dollars (USD 42) to 1,360 Singapore dollars (USD 1,000), to buy food, arms and weapons like knives and pistols to launch attacks in Bangladesh.

District Judge Kessler Soh sentenced the leader of the group, identified as Rahman Mizanur, to five years in jail. The 31-year-old was convicted of two charges of financing terrorism by inviting group members to contribute funds and handling the money to facilitate plans.

"He was the mastermind. He was the one who started this whole outfit," the judge said, adding that a deterrent sentence and "much stiffer punishment is warranted."

Mizanur is believed to have possessed guides on making weapons and bombs, as well as radical material from Daesh group and al-Qaeda that he used to recruit the others.

The three other Bangladeshis were identified as Miah Rubel, Muhammad Jabath Kysar Haje Norul Islam Sowdagar, and Sohel Hawlader Ismail Hawlader who were sentenced to two and a half years, two and a half years, and two years in prison respectively.

Singapore’s maximum sentence for funding terrorism is 10 years in jail accompanied by a fine of 500,000 Singapore dollars (USD 370,309).

Singapore arrested and deported 26 Bangladeshi construction workers in January, saying they had tried to form a group to spread ideologies of Daesh and al-Qaeda.
