A tourist from Singapore has pleaded not guilty to a raft of charges relating to a fatal accident near Oamaru last year.

Twenty-nine-year-old Wei Lew is facing three charges of dangerous driving causing injury, as well as dangerous driving causing the death of motorcyclist Craig Chambers, who died as a result of the November crash.

This morning in the Dunedin District Court, Lew pleaded not guilty to all charges.

However his lawyer Anne Stevens indicated he is willing to plead guilty to the lesser charge of aggravated careless driving causing death and injury.

Judge Crosbie remanded Lew on bail until a case review hearing in March.
