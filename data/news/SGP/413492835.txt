Singapore, March 2 (IANS) A Singapore court on Monday jailed an Indian for 16 years for bashing another Indian man to death.

Periyasamy Devarajan was 20 years old in 2012 when he bashed 31-year-old Raju Arivazhagen in the face and head with a rock, a branch and three concrete slabs each weighing 10.5 kg to 13.8 kg and dumped the body under the Kampong Java flyover, The Straits Times reported.

He was initially accused of murder but the charge was later reduced to culpable homicide.

No reason was given in court for why the charge was reduced.

The High Court heard that the two men, both construction workers, were strangers but chanced upon each other when Arivazhagen was looking for his lost wallet.

Besides the jail term, Devarajan has been ordered to be caned 12 strokes.
