Caning in Singapore dates back to the time of British colonial rule.

It involves the prisoner being handcuffed naked to a trestle and whipped with a 'rattan' cane.

A medical officer is present.

Those who have suffered the punishment, which is frequently criticised by human rights groups, say the pain is excrutiating.
