New Delhi [India], March 27 (ANI): The Supreme Court will today continue hearing the plea filed by the December 16 Nirbhaya gang rape convicts, challenging the Delhi High Court’s order.

The matter is being heard by the apex court bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra and Justices R. Banumathi and Ashok Bhushan.

The convicts – Akshay, Pawan, Vinay Sharma and Mukesh – challenged the Delhi High Court order which had sentenced them to the gallows, after keeping in view the fact that it was a rarest of the rare case.

Earlier, the trial court also had sentenced all the four convicts to death penalty.

On February 3, the Supreme Court accepted amicus curiae Raju Ramachandran’s submissions that there have been violation of procedure with regard to the sentencing of the four convicts. The accused were required to file their affidavits by February 23.

In December, 2012, six people gang raped a 23-year-old physiotherapy intern in a moving bus. The woman succumbed to her injuries in a Singapore hospital on December 29, 2012.

One of the accused, Ram Singh hanged himself in prison, while another man, who was a juvenile at the time of the crime, was convicted in August and will serve the maximum sentence of three years in a reform home.

On December 3, amicus curiae Sanjay Hegde questioned the evidence produced by the prosecution in the gang-rape case, and came out with certain points putting a question on the merit of evidence.

According to Hegde, one of the convicts, Mukesh, was not with the prime culprit Ram Singh when the offence was committed, since their mobile locations were found to be different on that night. (ANI)
