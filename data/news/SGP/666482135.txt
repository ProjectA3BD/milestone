Warmbier was released last week after almost a year and a half in prison, but he was in a coma which the North Korea claimed was caused by “botulism” and the consumption of a “sleeping pill.” American doctors found no evidence of botulism and determined he suffered a “severe neurological injury.” His father said he believes Otto was “terrorized and brutalized.” Warmbier passed away on Monday afternoon.
