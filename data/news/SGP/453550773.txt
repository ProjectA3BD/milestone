GELANG PATAH: A Singaporean lorry driver was detained following a brawl between him and another lorry driver at the Johor Customs, Quarantine and Immigration Complex at the Second Link here.

Nusajaya OCPD Supt Noor Hashim Mohamad said that the fight broke out between the Singaporean and the local man, both working in the island republic, at around 10pm Tuesday.

"Initial investigations showed that the Singaporean driver got riled up when the other driver approached him to collect a debt.

"The Singaporean then attacked the local man with a metal weapon," he told reporters here during the Hari Raya celebration at the state police headquarters here on Thursday.

He added that the 41-year-old local driver sustained injuries near his eyebrows and was sent to the Sultanah Aminah Hospital for treatment.

"We are investigating the case under Section 324 of the Penal Code for causing hurt using a dangerous weapon," he said.
