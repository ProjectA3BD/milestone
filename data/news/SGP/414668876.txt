The world was reminded once again of Singapore's tough stance on crime when two German men were sentenced on Thursday to nine months' jail and caning for vandalism.

Andreas Von Knorre, 22, and Elton Hinz, 21, broke into a suburban train depot and spray-painted graffiti on the exterior metro (MRT) train cabin in November 2014.

They fled to Malaysia after the incident but were arrested at Kuala Lumpur International Airport and extradited back to Singapore.

Both men expressed remorse in court when they were being sentenced at the Singapore State Courts.
