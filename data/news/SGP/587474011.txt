On the morning of Thursday, 3rd November 2016, HRH Princess Anne, accompanied by Government officials and dignitaries, will visit Singapore’s Jurong Port as President of The Mission to Seafarers Singapore (MTSS) and Patron of Riding for the Disabled Association (RDA).

The day begins with a horse display and presentation of Rosettes by Princess Anne to beneficiaries of RDA.

The focus will then move to a tour of MTSS Jurong Port ‘welfare of seafarers’ Drop-in-Centre to meet with MTSS volunteers, staff and, seafarers.

Finally, berthed alongside will be the amazing luxury tall ship, the Royal Albatross, which will host a reception to celebrate the work undertaken by MTSS and RDA. This will offer a unique networking opportunity for over 100 guests on board, as well as the chance to speak directly to HRH and other senior officials.

Furthermore, they will enjoy a performance of songs by the superb Paul Roberts (of Stranglers fame) from his forthcoming show, ‘Let’s Dance – Paul Roberts sings David Bowie’, which will continue after HRH has disembarked and the Royal Albatross sails on to Resorts World, Sentosa.

Capt Robert Walking, Chairman of The Mission to Seafarers Singapore said:“Thanks to the kind support of Princess Anne and the generosity our Sponsors and Partners, both charities will benefit greatly from this unique day, helping them to continue to help those who benefit from their vital work.”
