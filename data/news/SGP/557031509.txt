SINGAPORE: A 33-year-old man went on trial in the High Court for raping and molesting his biological mother, 56, at their home.

The safety coordinator, who faces one count each of rape, molestation and aggravated molestation, denies the charges.

All the alleged offences were committed at about 2.30am on Oct 4, 2013 in the family’s one-bedroom flat.

Opening the prosecution’s case, deputy public prosecutor Sella­kumaran told the court that the man, the second of three sons, lived with his mother and stepfather in the flat.

In the early hours of Oct 4, 2013, the victim was alone at home sleeping when her son returned.

During the trial, the court will hear testimony of how the accused “molested and raped his own mother despite her pleas for him to stop”, said the DPP.

The man, first charged in 2013, was originally scheduled to go on trial last November.

But the trial was postponed for him to decide if he wanted prominent lawyers senior counsels Harry Elias and Chelva Rajah to defend him under the Law Society’s Criminal Legal Aid Scheme. — The Straits Times/Asia News Network
