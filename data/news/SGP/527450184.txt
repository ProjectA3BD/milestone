PETALING JAYA: Sarawakian Jabing Kho (pic), who was convicted of murder, will be executed after his bid to commute a death sentence at Singapore's Court of Appeal failed on Tuesday.

The five-man Court of Appeal unanimously threw out Jabing's bid to escape the hangman's noose.

Jabing, 31, from Ulu Baram, Sarawak was found guilty of killing a Chinese construction worker with a tree branch back in 2008 during a robbery attempt.

He was scheduled to be executed on Nov 6 last year but received a stay the day before, after his lawyer filed a motion raising points of law about the way the case was handled.

Jabing's mother and sister, who were present in court, sobbed loudly upon hearing the verdict.

We Believe in Second Chances founder Kirsten Han said the appellate court made its decision on Tuesday.

"Stay of execution lifted, sentence of death upheld, " she told The Star Online.

Jabing was sentenced to death in 2010 but in August 2013, following revisions to Singaporeâ€™s mandatory death penalty laws, the High Court sentenced him to life and 24 strokes of the cane instead.

The prosecution challenged the decision before the Court of Appeal, which again sentenced Jabing to death in a 3-2 majority decision earlier this year.

On Oct 19, Singapore president Tony Tan rejected a clemency petition before a stay of execution by the Court of Appeal.

In 2013, the Singapore government amended the mandatory death penalty that gave judges the discretion to choose between death and life imprisonment with caning for murder, as well as certain cases of drug trafficking.
