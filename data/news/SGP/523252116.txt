They face charges under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, which states that employers are responsible for the "maintenance" of their foreign employee, including proving them with adequate food.

Ms Thelma earlier testified that she fled only after being mistreated and starved for over a year, as her employers were always following her around the house.

â€œEvery movement I do in the house, they are following, watching me, scolding me," she told the court in December last year.

A maid agent had also testified that Ms Thelma was not the first maid to complain of not being given adequate food or rest under the Lims' employment.

However, Lim had earlier said that he had never restricted Ms Thelma in any way. He also said his wife was obsessive about food because she had been diagnosed with anorexia nervosa as a teenager, and also suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder.

The couple are on bail of S$3,000 each, and face up to 12 months' imprisonment and a fine of S$10,000 if convicted.

Their case will be next heard on Wednesday.
