Master of Arts Asian Art Histories

These are exciting times for Asian art and artists, many of whom have attained international stardom buoyed by market demand and greater visibility in the international art circuit, as well as for Asian countries that have been transformed into major centres for the arts. The success and visibility of Asian art makes its research and study all the more timely and relevant, as economic and cultural shifts move the global balance of power from West to East.

The MA in Asian Art Histories is the first MA programme in any tertiary institution worldwide to focus on Asian modern and contemporary art. While Asian art programmes traditionally focus on the classical periods or grand traditions, the LASALLE programme gives students the opportunity to lead original research in largely underexplored fields, investigate recently emerged artists and movements, and thereby contribute to contemporary discourse and scholarship.

Master of Arts Art & Cultural Management

In Singapore, the arts, cultural and creative sectors are gaining global importance, fuelled by emerging talent, demographic and economic changes, public sector commitment and market dynamics. The times call for the growing importance and need for arts and cultural policy workers, curators and managers who are able to influence the conditions that catalyse and maintain a robust, active scene. The Arts and Cultural Manager makes things happen, provides strategic connections, creates opportunity, and forges new directions for the arts and creative landscape to thrive.

The MA in Arts and Cultural Management programme is designed to build on your professional expertise and provide you with the capacity to take on senior positions in the arts and cultural sector.

Master of Arts Fine Arts

The programme has unrelentingly worked at preparing our graduates for a rapidly evolving art landscape. Historically, Singapore’s strategic position has enabled it to play a critical role in mediating the communication between Southeast Asia and the world. Concurrently, Singapore’s committed investment in arts infrastructure has created a burgeoning arts industry that not only creates market opportunities for artists, but also facilitates the art-related negotiations as a meeting ground for renowned artistic talent and discourse to cross-pollinate.

Central to the programme’s philosophy is the role of the artist in developing ones own research-based practice. Believing that it is not enough to merely mirror global trends, the programme is the only practice-based programme in Singapore that prizes multidisciplinary practices while generating individual self-discipline, knowledge, and discoveries that enable the realisation of your artistic vocabulary. The programme also prides itself in working towards the sustainability of an artist.
