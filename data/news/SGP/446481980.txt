SINGAPORE: Teenage blogger Amos Yee (pic) was sentenced to four weeks in prison on Monday afternoon.

The 16-year-old has spent more than 50 days in remand to date and his sentence was backdated to June 2, meaning that he can walk free from court.

Yee was found guilty on May 12 of making remarks intending to hurt the feelings of Christians in an expletive-laden video and of uploading an obscene image.

Since his arrest in March, he repeatedly breached bail conditions and refused to speak to a probation officer.

He was remanded at the Institute of Mental Health for the past two weeks for psychiatric examinations, to assess his suitability for a Mandatory Treatment Order (MTO).

Under the law, anyone found guilty of making remarks with the deliberate intention of wounding the feelings of a religious group can be jailed for up to three years, or fined or both.

Anyone convicted of electronically transmitting an obscene image can be jailed up to three months or fined, or both.

On Sunday, 500 people turned up at a Hong Lim Park event to rally for Yee's release. â€“ The Straits Times/Asia News Network
