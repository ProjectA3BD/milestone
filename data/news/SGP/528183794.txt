SINGAPORE: A Malaysian was charged today in the District Court with the murder of a 28-year-old woman in a flat at Circuit Road last month, according to a report on The Straits Times website.

Boh Soon Ho, 47, is accused of killing Zhang Huaxiang, who is believed to have been his girlfriend, sometime between 12.54pm on March 21 and 8.40pm the next day, the report said.

It said Boh did not enter a plea to the charge, which was read out to him in Mandarin.

The police prosecutor successfully applied for Boh to be remanded for further investigations, the report said.

He will be brought back to court on April 14, it said.

The report said Boh was arrested by Malaysian police across the Causeway on Monday and handed over to Singapore police the next day.

If found guilty of the charge, Boh faces the mandatory death penalty, it said. â€” Bernama
