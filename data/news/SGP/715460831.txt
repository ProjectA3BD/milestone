An Indian engineer in Singapore has been jailed for three weeks for molesting a woman last year.

Prabu Natarajan, 33, admitted to rubbing his thigh against the 23-year-old, a part-time tutor, several times along Choa Chu Kang Loop on November 21 last year, the Strait Times reported on Friday.

The court on Thursday heard that Natarajan molested the woman in a bus while he was seated with her.

They got down at the same bus stop and he followed her into the lift at Block 290 Choa Chu Kang Avenue 3 and rubbed her arm up and down.

Natarajan was also fined 2,500 Singapore dollars for house trespass in 2012 in Choa Chu Kang Street 52.

He had inserted his hand into the flat through an open window with intent to annoy a then 23-year-old who was sleeping, the daily reported.

Seeking at least three weeks’ jail for the outrage of modesty, Deputy Public Prosecutor Chee Ee Ling said the offence occurred on public transport, the touch was a prolonged and persistent rub and the victim was trapped by Natarajan at the window seat while he persisted in molesting her.

This charge and a public nuisance offence were considered in the Indian man’s sentencing.

Natarajan could have been jailed for up to two years, fined, caned or received any combined punishment for molestation.
