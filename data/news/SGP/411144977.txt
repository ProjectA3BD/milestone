Singapore Hotels Honored in Travellers’ Choice Awards

When travelling to other places, it is important to have a comfortable and spacious lodging service so that after a whole day of exploring, tourists are able to relax and get their rest. Fortunately, in Singapore there are a lot of homegrown hotels and lodging establishments that are able to satisfy their clients.

TripAdvisor, a travel web portal, recently conducted their annual Traveller’s Choice Awards and is currently in their thirteenth year. Singapore hotel brands emerged as victors in this award-giving body.

Far East Hospitality, an AMOY hotel which was only recently opened, won two awards. One was for the Top Hotel in Singapore and another for the Best Hotel for Service in Singapore. Lloyd’s Inn, located in Orchard Road, was able to bag the Best Bargain Hotel in Singapore award. Lloyd’s Inn and Far East Hospitality AMOY have both been open for only a year or less, so it really comes as a pleasant surprise that they were able to nab the top spot.

Far East Hospitality has an Oriental style of interior décor that appeals to its clients and make them feel at home in their respectable rooms. Arthur Kiong, Far East Hospitality’s CEO said that they have their staff to thank for their success. He also declared that they have a group of people who are passionate in what they do and strive to give their best in everything.

Aside from the two top hotels that won the awards, other luxury hotels were also given credit for their continued excellence. Capella Singapore was awarded the Best Luxury in Singapore award while Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa was given the third spot for the Top Hotels For Families in Asia category.
