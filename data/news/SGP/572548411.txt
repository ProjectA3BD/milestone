New Delhi: Vinay Sharma, one of the four convicts in December 16, 2012, gang-rape, was admitted to a hospital in a critical condition on Thursday after he tried to commit suicide in Tihar Jail here.

Sharma was admitted to the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital after he consumed pills and tried to hang himself on Wednesday night.

He was hospitalised in the at 12.02 am, a hospital official said.

Responding to the development, Nirbhaya's mother said the convicts are reaping what they sowed in their lives.

"The sin of these people (all the convicts) will not allow them to live. My daughter survived without water for 13 days. She faced extreme pain and brutality," the victim`s mother said.

Similar sentiments were expressed by the victim`s father when he spoke to news agency IANS.

"It is good. It is a big thing that he is still alive, he should die very soon. He has to die in future, if he dies today, it would be a tribute to our daughter," said the distraught father.

In a telephonic conversation with IANS, the victim`s father, in his late 50s, said: "It is good for such people to die as they are dangerous for society and country".

"If he was committing suicide, he should do it. Not only he, I want to see all the convicts dead so that we can take a sigh of relief."

Meanwhile, Sharma`s lawyer AP Singh has claimed that it was not a suicide attempt but attempt to murder.

Sharma, Mukesh, Pawan, Akshay Thakur and Ram Singh, along with a juvenile, were accused of gang-raping and assaulting a 23-year-old paramedical student inside a private bus. The victim and her friend were thrown out of the bus after the crime.

The victim died of grave intestinal injuries December 29, 2012, at Singapore`s Mount Elizabeth Hospital where she was airlifted for specialised treatment.

In 2013, Ram Singh was found dead in the Tihar Jail.
