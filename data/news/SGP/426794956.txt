Singapore, Apr 20 (PTI) A Malaysian man was sentenced to death today for the 2010 murder of an Indian national working in Singapore's construction sector.

High Court Judge Choo Han Tek sentenced to death Michael Garing, 26. The judge said evidence showed that Garing was the one who had struck 41-year-old Shanmuganathan Dillidurai, killing him.

Garing, along with Tony Imba, 36, had fatally assaulted the construction worker on the intervening night of May 29-30, 2010. Imba was sentenced to life imprisonment.

Both men, from the East Malaysian state of Sarawak in Borneo, went on a robbery spree, injuring three victims and killing Shanmuganathan.

The dead man had a fractured skull, a severed left hand, a slash wound across his neck and a back wound so deep that his shoulder blade was cracked.

Both the accused were found guilty of murder in 2013 after a 12-day trial. But it has been almost another two years before they learnt their fates, the Straits Times reported.

The pair and two accomplices had attacked and robbed four men in the Kallang area on the night of the crime. They set upon two construction workers from India.

A Singaporean was also injured in the gang attack within the same area but at a different location.

One accomplice, is at large while the other, Hairee Landak, 22, was sentenced to 33 years in jail and 24 strokes of the cane for armed robbery with grievous hurt. He testified in the trial.

The accused's lawyer said his client would appeal his sentence.
