SINGAPORE, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The suspect who allegedly snatched a police officer's revolver and fired the gun at a hospital in Singapore has been charged for unlawful discharge of firearms at the State Courts on Monday.

Under the Arms Offenses Act, the suspect Muhammad Iskandar Bin Sa'at could face death penalty if convicted. He was charged with using a revolver to discharge three rounds with the intent to cause physical injury to the police officer Mohammad Sadli Bin Razali at a care corner of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital on June 20.

The prosecution, led by Deputy Public Prosecutor Winston Man, has asked for the accused to be remanded for a week to assist in further investigations as the charge is a "fairly serious and recent" one.

Singapore's Minister for Prime Minister's Office, Second Minister for Home Affairs Masagos Zulkifli on Monday said findings from the investigation on the shooting will help the authorities determine the kind of "correction" that will need to be taken to mitigate against a future occurrence.

The suspect was arrested for motor vehicle theft on June 19 and was brought to the hospital after complaining of chest pains. While inside one of the hospital's examination rooms, the man attempted to escape but was stopped by one of the police officers. The suspect snatched the police officer's revolver during the struggle, then the situation was brought under control swiftly, said the police.

The suspect sustained superficial injuries while the officer suffered gunshot wounds to his left thumb and right foot. The officer has undergone surgery and is currently in a stable condition.
