CHINESE police have “nabbed” 43 members of a gang suspected of operating a sex-for-sale scheme through the WeChat messaging app that cheated people living overseas out of 100 million yuan (US$15.2 million).

The suspects were detained on December 23 following an eight-month investigation, in the provinces of Zhejiang, Hunan, Fujian and Jiangxi, police said.

The gang offered “prostitutes” via the messaging service and victims were told to make their payments via online gaming cards, electronic gift cards and Alipay prepaid cards.

Between October 2014 and March last year, several Singaporeans complained to their local police that they hadn’t received the “prostitutes” they had ordered. Prostitution is illegal in China.

Hangzhou-based Alipay also received about 1,900 complaints about the alleged and forwarded them to police.

About 23,000 cases involving telecom or online fraud were reported in Hangzhou last year, an increase of 33 percent from 2014, while 564 suspects were arrested, the city’s police said.
