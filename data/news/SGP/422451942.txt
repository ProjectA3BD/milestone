PM Nguyen Tan Dung made that statement at his reception for Singaporean Speaker of Parliament Halimah Yacob on April 2.

Welcoming the Singaporean leader to Viet Nam, PM Dung highly valued the talks between the two nations’ Parliaments, expecting that her visit will promote Viet Nam-Singapore Strategic Partnership relations.

He sent his condolences over the recent decease of former Singaporean PM Lee Kuan Yew.

The PM suggested the two countries’ Governments, ministries and agencies make efforts to accelerate the bilateral cooperative relationship in all fields.

He hoped that the two sides will give priority to economic, trade and investment activities, proposing Singapore soon start the sixth Viet Nam-Singapore Industrial Park in the central province of Nghe An and the seven one in the northern province of Hai Duong.

The two nations should boost up cooperation in labor, education, training, human resource training, people-to-people-exchange and national security and defense in the future, he suggested.

For her side, Ms. Halimah Yacob hailed the two countries’ relationship, especially after establishing the Strategic Partnership relations.

She advocated strengthening the bilateral cooperation in such areas as economics, trade and investment.

The guest affirmed to cooperate with Viet Nam in establishing the ASEAN Community and congratulated Viet Nam on successfully organizing the 132nd Inter-Parliament Union (IPU-132) Assembly.
