On June 28, a grand jury found Dominic Badaracco Sr., 77, of Sherman, guilty of one count of bribery. Now he has been sentenced.

A former civilian Defense Department officer who oversaw military contracts has pleaded guilty to bribery in connection with a wide-spanning Navy corruption case involving a Malaysian businessman whom prosecutors say bilked the military out of more than $34 million.

Paul Simpkins entered his plea Thursday in federal court in San Diego. Prosecutors say he accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in exchange for helping Singapore-based businessman Leonard Francis. Simpkins could not be reached for comment.

Simpkins is among more than a dozen charged in the scandal centered on the Malaysian businessman, known by his nickname "Fat Leonard."

Francis pleaded guilty to bribery charges and is awaiting sentencing.

Prosecutors say Simpkins helped Francis' company, Glen Defense Marine Asia, get Navy contracts to service its ships.
