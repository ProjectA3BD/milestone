Jakarta, Aug 5 : Indonesia's anti-terror unit on Friday arrested six militants for planning attacks in Singapore.

The men, aged between 19 and 46, were arrested at several locations in nearby Batam island, the BBC reported.

The plot allegedly involved firing a rocket from Batam, just south of Singapore, at Marina Bay -- an upmarket, waterfront area.

Singapore officials said they were aware of the plot and security had been stepped up.

Indonesian police spokesman Boy Rafli told BBC Indonesian that the suspects were now being questioned.
