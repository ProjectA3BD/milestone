The police have arrested the remaining suspect of a four-man gang involved in a robbery and murder at Kallang Road in 2010.

The Singapore Police Force (SPF) said in a statement that the 25-year-old man was arrested in Malaysia with the help of the Royal Malaysia Police (RMP) and handed over to SPF on Wednesday (18 January).

The suspect is being investigated in connection with his role in the murder of 41-year-old Indian national construction worker Shanmuganathan Dillidurai, who was robbed and attacked by the gang in May 2010. The gang also attacked and seriously injured two other Indian nationals and one Singaporean prior to killing Dillidurai.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Investigations & Intelligence), Tan Chye Hee, said, “The excellent cooperation between SPF and RMP has always been instrumental in bringing criminals who committed cross-border crimes to justice. I would like to express my appreciation to the RMP for pressing on with their efforts to locate the murder suspect for this vicious crime which took place in 2010.”

The suspect will be charged on Friday (20 January) with murder. If convicted, he faces the death penalty. He is believed to be Donny Meluda, who has been on the run since the murder.

His arrest came after the three other gang members were previously sentenced for their role in the attack.

Hairee Anak Landak, 26, was jailed 33 years and given 24 strokes of the cane in 2013 after he pleaded guilty to armed robbery with grievous hurt.

Micheal Anak Garing, 28, was sentenced to death while Tony Anak Imba, 37, was jailed for life and given 24 strokes of the cane in 2015. The two are currently going through an appeal process with lawyers for Garing appealing for him to be spared the hangman’s noose while prosecution is asking for Imba to be sentenced to death.
