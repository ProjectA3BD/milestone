SAN DIEGO (CNS) - A former Naval Criminal Investigative Service supervisory special agent was sentenced to 12 years in federal prison Friday for taking bribes from a Singapore-based defense contractor in exchange for cash, luxury travel and the services of prostitutes in a massive fraud and corruption scandal.

John Beliveau II, 47, also was ordered to pay $20 million in restitution to the U.S. Navy.

He was immediately taken into custody after his sentence was handed down by U.S. District Judge Janis Sammartino.

Beliveau pleaded guilty in December 2013 to conspiracy to commit bribery and bribery.

According to admissions made in his plea agreement, Beliveau helped former Glenn Defense Marine Asia CEO Leonard Glenn Francis perpetrate a massive fraud scheme on the U.S. Navy by providing information that allowed Francis to evade and thwart criminal investigations into misconduct by GDMA.

"John Beliveau's deceit was a devastating blow to the U.S. Navy and ultimately the nation that he was sworn to protect," said U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy. "While this disgraced agent serves what may be the longest prison sentence ever handed down to a federal agent in a corruption case, his colleagues are left to rebuild the trust and credibility that he single- handedly destroyed."

According to his plea agreement, Beliveau acknowledged that he regularly searched confidential NCIS databases for reports of investigations related to Francis and GDMA.

In return, Beliveau demanded cash and prostitutes from Francis.

So far, a total of 16 people have been charged in connection with the GDMA corruption and fraud investigation.

Including Beliveau, 11 of those are current or former U.S. Navy officials.
