Lim, 32, then told employees who were working illegally to flee to escape arrest. He faces a similar charge of obstructing the course of justice.

Hui also allegedly tipped off another nightclub, Club De Colour 1, about the police raid, allowing employees of the club without the appropriate permits to escape before the police arrived.
