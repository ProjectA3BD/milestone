IPOH: Police in Penang rescued a 17-year-old boy three days after he was kidnapped in Taiping on Sept 2, with several suspects arrested around the country as far as Penang and Johor Baru.

Perak police chief Comm Datuk Hasnan Hassan said police arrested two suspects who were with the teenager during the rescue in Penang on Sept 5.

He added that 10 other suspects were also nabbed during multiple police raids at the same time â€“ two in Butterworth and eight in Johor Baru.

"The father of the victim is a second-hand dealer of car parts and accessories living in Taiping. He lodged a police report on Sept 3 after receiving a call the night before that his son had been kidnapped," said Comm Hasnan at a press conference on Wednesday.

The kidnappers had initially demanded a RM3mil ransom and threatened to kill the victim if their demands were not met.

After several phone conversations with the kidnappers, the father managed to reduce the ransom amount to RM300,000.

After the money was handed over to the kidnappers in Johor Baru on Sept 5, Comm Hasnan said police conducted multiple raids and nabbed a total of 12 suspects aged 17 to 36, some of whom have previous criminal records.

"The victim was unharmed but he was clearly traumatised from the incident. We managed to recover RM175,400 of the ransom money," he said.

Police seized two Perodua Myvi, a Toyota Vios and a Yamaha LC motorcycle.

Other items seized were eight sets of handphones and SIM cards, five sling bags, five sets of keys, two face masks, two sets of ropes, one safety pass from the Singapore auxiliary police force, a watch and several items of clothing.

Comm Hasnan said all suspects were remanded until Sept 18 to assist in investigations under Section 3 of the Kidnapping Act 1961.

"Five have been released on police bail, while we are awaiting the decision from the deputy public prosecutor for the next course of action on the remaining seven suspects," he said.
