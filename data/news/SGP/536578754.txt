The Singapore government said Tuesday it had arrested eight Bangladeshi men who allegedly plotted to carry out terror attacks, including assassinations, in their home country to establish an Islamic state.

The suspects were arrested in April and had originally planned to go to Syria to join the Islamic State group, the Singapore home ministry said.

Items seized included manuals on bomb-making, and a list of government and military officials targeted for attack.
