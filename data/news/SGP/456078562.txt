PM John Key has attended a special ceremony in Singapore to bless a pou whakairo and office building for Zespri.

The ceremony was part of our special tour of a delegation of Maori Kiwifruit growers in the country exploring the highly lucrative fruit market.

Key says he fully supports Maori in growing business opportunities in the Asian region and believes Maori culture can contribute highly to future success.

Our reporter Ripeka Timutimu will have a full report tonight at 530pm and 7pm.
