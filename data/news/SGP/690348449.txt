John Leary, who was jailed for kidnapping and holding his own child for ransom, has lost his inheritance from his mother after he was exposed lying about his circumstances to get a larger slice of her estate.

A NSW Supreme court heard that Leary, 49, was to have received $285,000 from his mother Colleen Pidcock, a renowned bridge player, who died in August, 2014.

Not content with an equal share of his late mother's estate, Leary sued the NSW Trustee and Guardian demanding his share be increased to $400,000.

John Justin Goyen Leary, the youngest of four children Mrs Pidcock had with her first husband, Andrew Leary, the long-time barrister to crime kingpin Lennie McPherson, argued that he was entitled to a larger share on the grounds that he was homeless, penniless and dependent on a disability pension.
