SINGAPORE: A Malaysian man was sentenced to 30 weeks imprisonment for illegally importing 11 puppies into Singapore in March.

Ravichandran Muthusamy, 43, was also sentenced to 20 weeksâ€™ imprisonment for subjecting the puppies to unnecessary pain or suffering.

Both sentences would run concurrently, said the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) and Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) in a joint statement on Wednesday.

About 9pm on March 23, a Malaysia-registered car driven by Ravichandran was directed for further checks upon arrival at the Woodlands Checkpoint.

During the inspection, officers from the ICA found 11 puppies hidden in a modified fuel tank of the vehicle.

The case was referred to AVA for investigations and it found that Ravichandran had been commissioned to smuggle the puppies for an unknown person in Singapore.

"He was instructed to drive the car into Singapore with the hidden puppies.

"There was no food or water provided for the puppies in the modified compartment of the car which was cramped and had limited space for the puppies to move," said the authorities.

The 11 puppies are currently being cared for and quarantined at AVA's facilities.

The importation of any animal or live bird without an AVA permit is illegal and carries a maximum penalty of S$10,000 and/or imprisonment of up to one year. -Bernama
