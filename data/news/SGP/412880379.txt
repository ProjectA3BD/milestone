An Indian national accused of brutally murdering a beautician was today given a discharge not amounting to acquittal but faces two fresh charges relating to the death of the Indian woman in December 2013.

The prosecution tendered two different charges against Gursharan Singh, who worked as a forklift driver here, for destructing evidence in a offence and failing to report the crime to a police officer.

Singh, 26, had been accused of murdering 33-year-old Indian national Jasvinder Kaur at a house in Balestier Road in December 2013.

He was charged today with disposing of Kaur's body at or around the Whampoa River.

He allegedly committed the offence with the woman's husband, logistics executive Harvinder Singh, 35, between December 11 and 12 that year.

Harvinder Singh, who is also from India, is now on Interpol's wanted list.

Gursharan Singh is also accused of intentionally withholding information about the offence from the police.

Kaur's body was found in a rubbish bag floating in the waterway between McNair Road and St George's Road.

Her head and hands were missing, and her arms had apparently been mutilated.

She came to Singapore from in September that year on a dependent's pass.

Gursharan Singh will appear in court again on March 20.
