SINGAPORE, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A Singapore teenager was charged on Tuesday with uploading online materials intending to hurt the religious feelings of Christians and offensive remarks on former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew.

Amos Yee Pang Sang, 16, was arrested on Sunday and faced three charges. He allegedly uploaded content which contained remarks of wounding the religious feelings of Christians deliberately.

He was accused of uploading an insulting video clip on YouTube with offensive remarks about Lee, who died last week at the age of 91.

Amos Yee was also said to have transmitted an obscene image.

The court granted him a bail for 20,000 Singapore dollars ( about 14,540 U.S. dollars) on condition that he will not post, upload or distribute any comment or content to any social media or online service or website pending the trial.

A pre-trial hearing has been set for April 17. Amos Yee's father said that he would like to say very sorry to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, the son of late Lee.
