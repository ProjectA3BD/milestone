JOHOR BARU: The remand order for a suspect believed to be involved in the brutal murder of a 44-year-old man at a petrol station in Taman Pelangi here has been extended for another seven days.

Magistrate Mohd Azlan Shah Mohd Allias allowed for the extension until Jan 4, 2018 after the case's investigation officer requested for it under Section 302 of the Penal Code for murder.

The 22-year-old suspect was among seven suspects who were detained in Singapore on Dec 20.

However, the remaining six had been released after their remand ended on Thursday (Dec 28).

A total of 15 people were initially held in connection of the alleged murder case with four suspects still being remanded.

On Dec 17, the case caught wide public attention when a video clip was uploaded online showing the victim, identified as a triad member, being dragged and stabbed by four suspects before being run over with the white BMW twice.

Following the incident, police arrested the suspects including four women, aged between 16 and 26, during a series of raids in Penang, Singapore and around the city area for investigation.
