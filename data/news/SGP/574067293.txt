SINGAPORE， Aug. 30 (Xinhua) -- Two Bangladeshi workers， who were detained under the Internal Security Act (ISA) in April， pleaded guilty to financing terrorism， local media reported here on Tuesday.

Zzaman Daulat and Mamum Leakot Ali， who had previously denied the charges against them under the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act (TSOFA)， pleaded guilty on Tuesday. This brings the number of those convicted under the new Act to six.

The two men were included in the group comprising of eight radicalized male Bangladeshi workers， who planned to return to overthrow the Bangladeshi government through the use of force， establish an Islamic state in Bangladesh. They were detained under ISA in April 2016.

Four members of the group， Rahman Mizanur， Miah Rubel， Md Jabath Kysar Haje Norul Islam Sowdagar and Sohel Hawlader Ismail Hawlader， had plead guilty in Singapore in May to one or two counts each of providing or collecting hundreds of dollars to fund terror attacks.

The four men were sentenced between 24 to 60 months in jail for financing terrorism. It was the first time that anyone had been convicted under the Act.
