The former editor of The Real Singapore (TRS) had at first denied using the site to "promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of the population of Singapore" via seven seditious posts, which targeted foreigners from the Philippines, India and China.

SINGAPORE: The man who set up sociopolitical site The Real Singapore, but denied publishing anti-foreigner posts on the blog, has made an about-turn and is expected to plead guilty to six counts under the Sedition Act on Friday (Jun 22).

Yang Kaiheng had at first denied using TRS to "promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of the population of Singapore" via seven seditious posts which targeted foreigners from the Philippines, India and China.

His expected plea of guilt comes after the prosecution poked holes in his defence during the first tranche of his trial earlier this year, prompting him to admit he had lied under oath.

Yang's wife, Ai Takagi, is currently serving a 10-month jail term after she admitted to publishing doctored and "patently false" information on TRS, to fan anti-foreigner sentiments in Singapore. She pleaded guilty earlier this year to four counts under the Sedition Act. She is pregnant with the couple's first child.

For sedition, Yang could face up to three years' jail and/or a fine of up to S$5,000 per charge.
