Jakarta: Indonesian authorities arrested six suspected militants on Batam island on Friday who were believed to be linked to the Islamic State group and plotting an attack on nearby Singapore, an Indonesian police spokesman said.

According to The Straits Times, the alleged attackers were planning to launch a rocket to Singapore's Marina Bay area via Batam, which is about 15 kilometres south of the city-state.

Indonesian police spokesman Agus Rianto told reporters the suspects had been plotting with a member of the Islamic State militant group in Syria.

"What we understand so far is that they were planning to attack vital objects, busy areas including police offices," Rianto said.
