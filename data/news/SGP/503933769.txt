Two men were jailed and caned for their roles in various vicious attacks.

Two Singaporean men were jailed on Wednesday (Jan 20) for 4 1/2 and five years for their roles in various vicious attacks.

Dinesh Kumar Ruvy (below) and Jai Ganesh Tanapolan, both 25 now, were also each given six strokes of the cane.

The duo had participated in one attack on March 21 last year near Rendezvous Hotel.

Dinesh used a chopper to slash a 28-year-old man on his left forearm.

Jai, who received the longer jail term, was previously involved in a clash with a rival gang at a club at Liang Court Shopping Centre on Oct 22, 2014.

The following month on Nov 18 (2014), Jai was part of a three-man group who had attacked a sleeping 17-year-old teen at his home in Bishan.

Jai had cut the teen's face with a knife and punched and kicked a 22-year-old male friend sleeping in the teen's room.
