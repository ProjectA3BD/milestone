Attacks by suicide bombers and gunmen blamed on the Islamic State (IS) movement in the heart of Jakarta have incited condemnation from around the world, with leaders offering any support that the Indonesian government may need to tackle these terrorism acts.



Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Canberra condemned the attacks and, while the incident was still unfolding, that it was too early to determine the scale of damage or the extent of casualties.



'I have spoken to Indonesian Foreign Minister [Retno LP] Marsudi and offered any support that Indonesia may need to respond to these attacks,' Bishop said.



US Secretary of State John Kerry expressed condemnation over the attack. 'These acts of terror are not going to intimidate nation-states from protecting their citizens and continuing to provide real opportunity, education, jobs, possibilities of a future,' said Kerry during a break in talks in London with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir.



'There is nothing in any act of terror that offers anything but death and destruction. And so we stand together, all of us, united in our efforts to eliminate those who choose terror,' he said as quoted by Reuters.



Al-Jubeir also condemned the attacks, saying it should strengthen resolve to work effectively together to combat the scourge of terrorism.



Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said he was deeply shocked and saddened by the attacks in Jakarta. 'Malaysia stands ready to help in any way. Thoughts and prayers with the Indonesian people,' Najib said on Twitter.



Condemning the attack, Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said that terrorism had raised its ugly head and once again innocent civilians were its victims.



Koenders expressed his condolences and offered his country's assistance to Retno, 'Should Indonesia need it.'



The attacks show once more that terrorism has spread its tentacles all around the world, Koenders said.



'Anyone can be a victim of terrorism. Whether you're shopping in the centre of Paris, sitting in an office in New York or on holiday in Jakarta. This is the fear that terrorists seek to plant in our hearts,' the minister said.



The embassy is also staying in close touch with local authorities to find out about possible Dutch victims. So far it has learned that one Dutch man was seriously injured in the attack.



Local authorities have recorded that Johan Kieft suffered heavy injuries to his right hand and his head, as well as a fracture to his right leg. He is currently under the care of medical personnel at the Gatot Subroto Army Central Hospital (RSPAD) in Central Jakarta.



Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said he was shocked and dismayed by news of the attacks. 'Singapore condemns these attacks. We will give our full support to the Indonesian government to bring the perpetrators to justice. My thoughts are with the families of the victims and the Indonesian people,' he added.



Singapore's Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, who just visited Jakarta, said Singapore was monitoring the situation in Indonesia with great concern, adding that there have been no reports of Singaporeans hurt in the Jakarta blasts.



European Union High Representative and Vice-President Federica Mogherini underlined that Thursday's attack was a tragic reminder that the threat of terrorism was global and has to be tackled globally.



'Our hearts go out to the families and friends of the victims. We stand firm by the Indonesian government and its people in their fight against violence and extremism. I will personally convey my condolences to the Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi ' with whom I also spoke a few days ago ' in a phone call later today,' Mogherini said on Thursday. 'The European Union will continue to work with Indonesia to defend peace and the values of freedom and diversity, which underpin our societies.'



The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) has also condemned the bomb attacks and series of shooting in the Indonesian capital, with Secretary-General Iyad Ameen Madani sending his 'heartfelt condolence to the families of the victims of the attack and his wishes for the fast recovery of the injured'.



Madani strongly condemned the perpetrators 'of this heinous act committed against the peaceful community of Jakarta', restating the OIC's position that denounces all acts of terrorism and violent extremism and rejecting any justifications for terrorism.
