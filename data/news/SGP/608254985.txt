SINGAPORE - A 41-year-old man accused of abusing a woman in Lower Delta Road has been granted a discharge not amounting to an acquittal on all his three charges.

Darwinder Singh Sukhdev Singh was charged on July 24 last year with abetting his next-door neighbour Siti Nur Redha Khamis, 25, to feed her mother Kamisah Burel, 58, human faeces and urine.

The next week, on July 30, he was charged with abetting Madam Kamisah's husband Khamis Abas in feeding her faeces and urine.

He was also charged with slapping Mr Khamis' face once.

Deputy Public Prosecutor Kelly Ho told a district court on Wednesday (Dec 14) that the prosecution was withdrawing all three charges of causing hurt.

No reason was given for the withdrawal.

The case came under the spotlight when another neighbour, Mr Mohammad Juani, 25, posted a video on Facebook of a frail-looking Madam Kamisah being slapped hard by Ms Siti outside their third-storey home at Block 48, Lower Delta Road.

As Madam Kamisah attempted to steady herself, she was slapped again on the other side of her face.

The 77-second video went viral and was viewed more than half a million times within a day, prompting a surge of online outrage.

The Ministry of Social and Family Development also responded with a statement less than three hours after the video was uploaded, saying it was looking into the matter.

Mr Juani claimed the abuse had been going on almost daily for six months.

Neighbours had last year told The Straits Times that they often saw the older woman being physically abused, and that her husband and daughter were responsible.

Both have yet to be charged with any crime.
