South Korean jailed two months in Singapore for bribery

A woman from South Korea has been given a two month's jail for attempting to bribe police officers here in Singapore, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) said in a news release on Thursday.



Hwang Eunmi, who was arrested for an immigration offense, was charged earlier this month for offering police officers 1,550 Singapore dollars (about 1,133 US dollars) to release her from custody. CPIB said the sentence will be backdated to the day she was first remanded, which was on July 3.



CPIB stressed that Singapore holds "zero tolerance" towards corruption and trying to bribe a police officer is an offense. Those convicted of corruption may face a fine of up to 100,000 Singapore dollars or a maximum five years' jail, or both.
