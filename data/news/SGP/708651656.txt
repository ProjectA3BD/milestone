A father pleaded guilty to abandoning his then 11-year-old disabled son in Singapore three years ago at the Kwun Tong Magistrates' Courts today.

The case was adjourned until December 12 for sentencing and the 48-year-old man was remanded in custody.

He was charged with willfully abandoning a child last Thursday.
