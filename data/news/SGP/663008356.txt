SINGAPORE: Nearly 3,000 cartons of duty-unpaid cigarettes were seized last Friday (Jun 2) in two separate raids by Singapore Customs - one at a farm and the other at a commercial building.



In the first operation, officers moved in on a van parked inside the farm in Sungei Tengah Road, after seeing a man coming out from a unit in the farm. The vehicle was filled with brown boxes containing the duty-unpaid cigarettes.
