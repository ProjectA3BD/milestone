A wild board has caused an accident involving two people at the Ayer Rajah Expressway on Thursday morning (September 28).

The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) deployed an ambulance to the accident scene at Tuas Checkpoint on receiving an alert at 7:30 am.

A 38-year-old male motorcyclist and a 35-year-old female pillion rider were left unconscious following the incident and were immediately rushed to Ng Teng Fong General hospital.

A Facebook group posted photos showing people gathering the injured. The boar was seen lying there, apparently dead.

Facebook user Jackie Lim, who had uploaded the shots, wrote in her post that "Just had an accident, at the second channel, out of the Singapore level.. (Big Tuas)...500 m. In Singapore, this accident happened...The wild boar caused a traffic accident, and the good luck did not lead to casualties"

This is not the first accident that has been caused by a wild boar. Many accidents have been previously recorded around the area, some even caused by herds of boars.
