Robert Parker Wine Advocate (RPWA), the global authority and guide on fine wines, is launching its inaugural edition of GastroMonth in Singapore today.

You will also recall that the publication also joined forces with Michelin in 2016 to bring the MICHELIN guide to Singapore for the first time.

At this month-long event, gourmets in Singapore can enjoy the chance to dine at Michelin-starred restaurants and relish specially-curated dishes at never-before pocket-friendly prices.

The organizer is concurrently holding the Matter of Taste wine events alongside GastroMonth, where wine connoisseurs, sommeliers and purchasers can explore over 200 prestigious and undiscovered wines around the world that are rated RP90 and above, with a select few rated RP100.

The event will culminate in the Circle of Excellence Awards (Singapore), set to take place on 4 November, celebrating the heroes of the local F&B industry.

Over 40 restaurants are participating in Gastromonth, including three Michelin-starred Joël Robuchon, two Michelin-starred Shoukouwa and one Michelin-starred Chef Kang's.

Guests will enjoy exclusive privileges such as a private tour of Joël Robuchon’s kitchen; a very luxurious omakase menu available at Shoukouwa during lunch at only S$240++ (Usual price: $320++); priority bookings for Chef Kang’s, which has long waitlists; and a complimentary masterclass hosted by Christopher James Millar of Stellar @ 1-Altitude.

All participating restaurants, from casual concepts serving quality comfort food to Michelin-starred establishments displaying stellar levels of innovation and sophistication, will be welcoming GastroMonth guests with specially curated lunch and dinner menus exclusively for this event.

The menus are attractively priced, with set lunches starting from $38++, and five-course dinner starting from $100++. Guests can book their reservations directly at https://www.gastromonth.com/dine/
