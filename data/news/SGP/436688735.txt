Three months after four people ­ a brother-sister duo, their mother, and her part ner ­ committed suicide in Oshiwara, leading to the arrest of the victims' employer Tinksingh Kishan Singh, the Oshiwara police last week filed a 700-page chargesheet, indicting him of abetting suicide and sexual assault.Siblings Bharti Pal, 25, and Somnath Pal, 20, who were Singh's live-in help, were found dead in his Lokhandwala apartment on February 20.When the police reached their mother Shikha's home in the evening, they found that she along with her partner Manoj Patel had also committed suicide.Based on the notes and the video messages left behind by the victims, Singh was accused of sexually assaulting Bharti and torturing Somnath, and booked under sections 306 (abetment to suicide), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.Singh had countered the charges saying he was impotent. The chargesheet, however, said that Singh was not able to digest the fact that Bharti had turned down his marriage proposal, and had sexually assaulted her on several occasions.Suspecting her of having an affair, he would confine her to the apartment, and would thrash Somnath every time he tried rescuing his sister, the chargesheet said.According to the chargesheet, the police have found video clips showing pornographic material stored in Singh's laptop. “He would force Bharti to watch these slips,“ the chargesheet said, adding that police have proof of Singh using escort services while on a visit to Singapore.Senior Inspector Subash Vele from Oshiwara Police Station said, “We have attached the medical reports with the chargesheet which say Singh is not impotent. We have proof that he used escort services during his Singapore trip recently, and have enough evidence to prove that he tortured Bharti and her brother Somnath.“
