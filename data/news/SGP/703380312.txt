Stanbic has been named the best private bank in Kenya for the third year running in recognition of its wealth investment and management arms.

The 2017 Banker and Professional Wealth Management Global Private Banking Awards held last week in Singapore also saw it clinch the accolade for its units in Ghana and Nigeria.

Stanbic Bank Wealth and Investment has a presence in South Africa, Mauritius, Jersey and London. The award comes a week after the bank was named as the “Safest Bank in Kenya” by the Global Finance.
