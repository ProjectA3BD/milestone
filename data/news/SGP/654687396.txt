SINGAPORE - A woman from Moldova has been sentenced to four weeks' imprisonment for attempting to bribe three police officers.

Belousova Natalia had been charged on April 13 with one count of corruptly offering gratification to the three police officers as an inducement to be released from police custody.

This transpired when she was arrested for suspected vice activity at Swissotel Stamford on April 11.

Investigations revealed that Natalia had offered "money and gifts" to all three police officers in exchange for her release from police custody.

This was despite being warned that it is an offence to bribe police officers in Singapore.

Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to $100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years or to both.
