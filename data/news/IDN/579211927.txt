Britons involved in Bali ferry explosion which left at least one tourist dead

British people have been caught up in an explosion on board a tourist boat in Bali in which a German woman was killed.

Around 20 people were injured when the ferry blew up near a port in the east of the island, the Associated Press reported.

Images circulated on social media appeared to show bloodied passengers in lifeboats and others being helped by crew and locals on the Indonesian island.

A woman being carried appears to have both feet almost blown off in one graphic picture.

The Foreign Office said it is assisting British holidaymakers affected by the explosion.

A faulty battery may have sparked the blast, which happened just 200 metres from the departure port of Padang Bai harbour, reports suggested.

The Gili Cat 2 speedboat had more than 40 people on board, all of whom have been evacuated with the injured being treated at a local medical centre, Karangasem police chief Bambang Sudarso told reporters.

"One of the passengers died from bad injuries after being hit by boat debris that also caused injuries in others," he said.

There were unconfirmed reports that a second person had died.

The boat was travelling to the small island of Gili Trawangan, off neighbouring Lombok, and was carrying tourists from Britain, Australia, Germany, France and South Korea.

Police are now questioning the boat's captain.
