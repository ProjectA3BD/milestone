The National Police cyber crime unit has arrested a 45-year-old man using the YouTube account, ‘Professor’ Tamim Pardede, in Tangerang, Banten for allegedly posting videos containing hate speech against President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo.

National Police spokesperson Sr. Com. Martinus Sitompul confirmed the arrest, saying that the man, whose real name is Muhammad Tamim Pardede, had allegedly insulted the government. Tamim also shared videos containing provocative statements on ethnicity, religion and race issues (SARA).

“We arrested him in Adiloka Megasari in Tangerang [Banten],” Martinus said, as quoted by tempo.co.

Police also confiscated a laptop and a cellular phone on which Tamim saved his Youtube account, as well as a copy of a video he shared, Martinus said.

According to Martinus, the professor title in his account name is fake as the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) has confirmed he is not a research professor from the institute, even though Tamim has claimed he belongs to LIPI.

Tamim will be charged under law No.19/2016 on Information and Electronic Transactions.

The arrest of Tamim Pardede follows the arrest of a 35-year-old man identified as Muhammad Said, the owner of facebook account "Ahmad Fatihul Alif," who was arrested on Sunday in West Jakarta for insulting the president and National police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian on social media. (yon/dmr)
