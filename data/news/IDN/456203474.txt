Another day of cancelled Bali flights

Flights in and out of Bali have again been cancelled as winds exacerbate the volcanic ash cloud from Indonesia's Mount Raung.

Virgin Australia has cancelled all of its flights in and out of Denpasar Airport on Sunday.

Jetstar has cancelled six of its scheduled Sunday flights.

Both airlines were forced to cancel flights on Saturday as Mt Raung continued to erupt.

Winds blowing in an unfavourable direction on Saturday are expected to continue throughout the next day, the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre has forecast.
