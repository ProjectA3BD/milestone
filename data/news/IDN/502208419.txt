JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Terrorists set off several explosions at a Starbuck's caf√© in the middle of a popular shopping center in the country's capital.

Officials say 5 attackers and 2 civilians were killed, while 10 others were injured, following a series of gun and bomb attacks on Thursday.

The attacks took place on Thamrin Street, not far from UN offices and the U.S. embassy.

Indonesian military officials say the assailants imitated the terror attacks that killed dozens of people in Paris late last year. Officials do not believe any of the attackers are unaccounted for.

While no one has taken responsibility for the attacks, a media outlet connected to ISIS claims the group carried out the terror strike.

Leaders across the Middle East and Asia are condemning the attacks and offering sympathy and support for the people of Indonesia.
