JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — An Indonesian court has sentenced a Canadian teacher to 10 years in jail on charges of sexually abusing three young children at a prestigious international school.

The South Jakarta District Court convicted Neil Bantleman on Thursday of violating Indonesia’s Child Protection Law and Criminal Code.

Bantleman, who was arrested last July, pleaded innocent to the accusation that he sexually abused three kindergartners at the Jakarta Intercultural School and said he would appeal the ruling. The parents of one of the children have sued the school for $125 million.

The three-judge panel also ordered 45-year-old Bantleman to pay a fine of approximately $7,700 or serve six more months in jail.

The school is attended by children of foreign diplomats, expatiates and Indonesia’s elite. It has 2,400 students from about 60 countries.
