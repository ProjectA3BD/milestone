British holidaymakers in Indonesia are being warned volcanic ash clouds could cause flight disruption amid fears of an imminent eruption on the tourist island of Bali.

More than 57,000 people have fled the danger zone, which extends up to 7.5 miles from Mount Agung’s crater, after authorities raised its alert status to the highest level on Friday.

The volcano, 45 miles to the north-east of the tourist hotspot of Kuta, last erupted in 1963, killing 1,100 people.

About 330,000 British nationals visit Indonesia every year, according to the Foreign Office.

The latest Government advice to Britons planning to visit the region says the National Disaster Management Authority for Indonesia’s volcanic alert level indicates “an eruption is possible in the next 24 hours”.

“You should follow the advice of the local authorities and stay outside the exclusion zone,” it says.

“If there is an eruption, volcanic ash clouds could cause flight disruptions.

“In the event of volcanic ash clouds you should confirm your travel arrangements directly with your airline or travel agent before travelling to the airport.”

Travel trade organisation Abta said the volcano is around 40 miles from Kuta.

A spokesman said: “The Indonesian authorities have kept the alert level at the highest classification, meaning an eruption could be imminent.

“There will only be a relatively small number of UK holidaymakers on the island at this time of year, although Bali is a major tourist destination for the Australian market.

“Holidaymakers are advised to follow the advice of local authorities, to avoid the area around the volcano and to keep in contact with their airline or holiday company.”
