NOOR Ellis, accused of masterminding the murder of her Australian husband in Bali, will have to wait till next week to learn her fate after her case was adjourned.

Noor arrived at the court from Kerobokan prison and was in the holding cells awaiting her case.

Her two sons, with her husband Bob Ellis, whose murder she is accused of organising, were at the court but have already publicly disowned her as their mother and have not spoken with her.

A large contingent of family members from Mr Ellis’ side are also at the court to hear the verdict.

Noor Ellis is accused of organising and paying a group of five hitmen a total of $14,200 to kill her husband of 25 years in their Sanur villa in Bali.

She admits recruiting the group but denies she asked for him to be murdered, saying instead she asked that he be given a talking to, claiming he was womanising and keeping money from her, both claims which their children deny.

Mr Ellis’ body, bound and wrapped in plastic, was discovered dumped in a rice paddy ditch. His throat had been cut.

Police soon arrested his wife Noor and their two housemaids and began a manhunt, alleging that Mr Ellis’ throat had been slashed in the kitchen area of their Sanur villa on October 19 last year.

The hitmen were arrested and are all on trial for premeditated murder as well.

Prosecutors have recommended that Noor be jailed for 15 years. The maximum penalty for premeditated murder in Indonesia is the death penalty.

Mr Ellis’ family have said that they are disappointed with the 15-year demand and were hoping for a life sentence.

Judges are not bound by the prosecution recommendation and can sentence higher or lower.
