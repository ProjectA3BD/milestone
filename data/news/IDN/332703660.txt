The House of Representatives has officially reinstated the direct-election system for regional heads after a plenary meeting on Tuesday approved the endorsement of two regulations in lieu of law (Perppu) on regional elections.

As many as 442 lawmakers from all political factions -- the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), the Golkar Party, the Gerindra Party, the Democratic Party, the National Mandate Party (PAN), the National Awakening Party (PKB), the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), the United Development Party (PPP), the NasDem Party and the Hanura Party -- attending the plenary meeting unanimously gave the regulations the nod, although some proposed revisions of several articles on technicalities.

"As all factions are agreed, the House has officially endorsed the [two] Perppu," House Deputy Speaker Agus Hermanto of the Democratic Party who directed the plenary meeting said on Tuesday.

The plenary tasked the House's Commission II overseeing domestic governance, regional autonomy, state aparatus and agrarian affairs to deliberate the amendment.

The two Perppu were submitted by then president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono approaching the end of his term in response to nationwide criticism of his Democratic Party, whose lawmakers controversially walked out during a plenary meeting that eventually approved a law on election by the regional legislative councils (DPRDs) instead.

With the endorsement of the two Perppu, voters can directly cast their votes for their regional heads in the 204 regional elections to take place this year. (nfo)(+++)
