Jakarta: Indonesia has cracked down on terrorists incarcerated on the notorious penal island of Nusakambangan amid concerns the Jakarta attacks were plotted there behind bars.

Fairfax Media understands 27 mobile phones were found in the cells of Indonesia's leading pro-Islamic State cleric Aman Abdurrahman and the Australian embassy bomber Rois after the January 14 attacks.

The four terrorists killed in the Jakarta bombings had reportedly visited Nusakambangan three times since May last year.

Chief Security Minister Luhut Panjaitan led a delegation to the island on Thursday after ordering radical extremists be moved to a maximum security unit in Pasir Putih prison.
