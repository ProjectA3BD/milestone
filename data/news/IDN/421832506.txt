Weeks after jailing opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim for five years, Malaysia's government has escalated a crackdown on civil liberties and freedom of speech.

Five senior journalists are the latest targets in a mounting tally of detentions under a draconian sedition law that Prime Minister Najib Razak promised to abolish in 2012, describing it as of a "bygone era."

Critics are comparing sweeping arrests to an infamous 1987 political crackdown by former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad that crushed his political opponents.

Senior opposition figure Lim Kit Siang estimates that more than 100 people have been detained over the past week. In February, authorities arrested the popular cartoonist Zunar.
