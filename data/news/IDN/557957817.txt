Three people have been killed in an Indonesian military helicopter crash in the province of Central Java.

Indonesia's disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said six passengers were on board the helicopter when it crashed into a suburban area north of the city of Yogyakarta on the island of Java on Friday.

"Three personnel died," the spokesman said, adding that three other people were also seriously wounded.

The helicopter reportedly fell on a house, damaging it heavily. The local broadcaster TV One said the house was empty at the time of the incident.

The disaster agency said the chopper apparently had engine trouble shortly before the crash, but it has not confirmed the cause of the crash.

The Indonesian military has gone through several incidents of the crash of its aircraft in the recent years. The latest incident was in March, when a helicopter went down in central Indonesia due to bad weather, killing 12 people.

A month earlier, a pilot was killed as a military plane crashed into a house in an urban area in Java during a test flight. The crash also killed two people who were in the house.

In June last year, a Hercules C-130 crashed into a residential neighborhood in the city of Medan on Sumatra island. Over 140 people died in the plane crash.
