Indonesian prosecutors called on Thursday for Jakarta's Christian governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, to be jailed for one-year on blasphemy charges, in a trial that is seen as a test of the Muslim-majority nation's religious tolerance.

Purnama, 50, is heading for defeat in his bid to remain governor in this week's election against Muslim opponent Anies Baswedan after a bitterly fought campaign that saw hundreds of thousands of Muslims protest against the incumbent for allegedly insulting Islam.

Purnama has denied the blasphemy charges and a verdict is expected in coming weeks.
