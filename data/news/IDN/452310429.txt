Labor has formally condemned Indonesia's execution of Bali Nine ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.

The party's national conference on Sunday passed a resolution that "condemns these executions in the strongest possible terms" and commits a future Labor federal government to push for a global moratorium on the death penalty.

Drug smugglers Chan and Sukumaran were executed by firing squad in late April amid an outcry from Australia at Indonesia's continued use of the death penalty.
