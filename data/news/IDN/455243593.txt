INDONESIAN police have reportedly arrested an Australian businessman involved in disputes over a coal project and a Bali villa.

The Bali Tribune reported on Wednesday that Patrick Alexander was arrested in Jakarta on Saturday.

Mr Alexander, a former diplomat, has previously denied any wrongdoing in regard to an allegation of embezzlement over a failed coal project in Sumatra.

He was previously in Indonesian custody in 2013 after a German man linked with his failed Bengkulu Coal project filed a complaint against him.

While he denied wrongdoing, there were counterclaims that Indonesian police had demanded a $US1.3 million ($A1.76 million) “mediation” payment to settle the dispute over a $US500,000 debt. Indonesian media reported police officers attending the man’s home in the Bintaro area of Jakarta did not have a warrant.

His wife and lawyer described the police action as a “kidnapping” and were seeking details of charges.

Mr Alexander was also known to be in a dispute with Indonesian model and actor Jeremy Thomas.

The Bali Tribune said Mr Thomas had been entangled in a property dispute over an Ubud villa dating back to October 2014.

The actor alleges Mr Alexander, the former owner of the villa, scammed him, the online publisher reported.

Mr Alexander had used the name of an Indonesian proxy to hold the villa, because foreigners can’t hold foreign assets in their own names.

A spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told AAP on Wednesday: “We are aware of the arrest of an Australian man in Indonesia and we will make a consular visit to him as soon as local authorities permit.” She declined to provide any further information for privacy reasons.
