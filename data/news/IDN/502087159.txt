The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for a bomb and gun attack in Jakarta, Indonesia, according to Reuters.

"A group of soldiers of the caliphate in Indonesia targeted a gathering from the crusader alliance that fights the Islamic State in Jakarta," the terrorist group said in a statement cited by Reuters.



The attack in the center of Indonesia's capital left at least seven people dead. The first of at least six explosions — some of which were believed to be suicide attacks — were reported by local media at about 11 a.m. local time (11 p.m. New York time).

Jakarta police said on Twitter that the explosion occurred in front of the Sarinah mall. Media reported that a police post outside the mall was blown up.

The area is home to luxury hotels and some embassies, as well as the mall.
