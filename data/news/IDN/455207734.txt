JAKARTA, Aug 5, 2015:

A former US policeman has been arrested on the Indonesian resort island of Bali over alleged links to the murder of his pregnant girlfriend, officials said on Wednesday.

Vontrey Clark was detained on Friday after Interpol, acting on a request from the FBI, issued a red notice for his arrest.

“He was arrested last Friday by investigators in Bali,” the secretary of Interpol’s national central bureau for Indonesia, Brigadier-General Amhar Azeth, told AFP.

“He is wanted for murder.”

US media reported that the former Austin policeman was being investigated for possible involvement in the death of police counsellor Samantha Dean in February. He has not been charged.

Dean’s body was found with three gunshot wounds to the head behind a vacant shopping centre on Feb 4, local newspaper The Austin Chronicle reported.

Bali police spokesman Heri Wiyanto said Clark arrived in Jakarta on July 18 on a tourist visa. He was later arrested at a north Kuta hotel.

Indonesia and the United States have no extradition treaty, but Azeth said arrangements were being made for Clark to be flown back to the US on August 13.
