Members of an ABC Four Corners crew have been detained in Malaysia while trying to question Prime Minister Najib Razak over a corruption scandal, the broadcaster has announced. The ABC confirmed that journalist Linton Besser and camera operator Louie Eroglu were detained and released hours after attending a press conference in the city of Kuching. Their passports were seized and they have been told not to leave the country, the ABC reported. "They have not been charged with any offence," an ABC spokesperson said on Sunday. According to Sarawak police, the crew were arrested after they allegedly crossed a security cordon to interview the prime minister at 8.35pm on Saturday. A report lodged by an officer in the Prime Minister's security detail following the incident called their approach "aggressive" It's understood they were detained for six hours before being released on police bail. The television crew had been in Malaysia investigating allegations of corruption and bribery linked to the killing of socialite Altantuya Shaariibuu. Ms Shaariibuu was killed in 2006, allegedly by two of Malaysia Prime Minister Najib Razak's bodyguards. Besser had attempted to put questions to the Prime Minister about the case only hours before he was detained. Last month, Reporters Without Borders criticised Malaysia for its treatment of journalists, including blocking access to news websites that had reported on government corruption allegations. Malaysia is ranked 147 out of 180 countries in the 2015 world press freedom index. Besser did not respond to calls and emails.
