NEW Zealander Antony de Malmanche has been sentenced to 15 years' jail for drug trafficking by a Bali court unmoved by evidence of his mental illness and manipulation by online scammers.

THE 53-year-old says he didn't know 1.7kg of crystal meth was in his backpack when he flew to Bali on December 1, where he believed he would be meeting a woman he had been chatting with online.
