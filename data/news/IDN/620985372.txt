Indonesia's anti-graft commission has arrested one of the country's most senior judges on suspicion of taking a bribe in a Constitutional Court case.

A deputy chairwoman of the independent Corruption Eradication Commission, Basaria Panjaitan, announced today that Constitutional Court Judge Patrialis Akbar was caught "red-handed'' along with 10 other suspects in an anti-graft sting.

She said Akbar was suspected of receiving US$161,000 from a meat importer in connection with the court's judicial review of a revision to a law on animal husbandry.

The deeply conservative former law and human rights minister is the second judge of the Constitutional Court to be arrested in a corruption case.

Akil Mochtar, chairman of the court's nine-member judge panel, was arrested in October 2013 and later sentenced to life imprisonment. -AP
