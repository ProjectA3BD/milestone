Foreigners including Indonesians and Malaysians are among the Islamist militants engaged in battles with the Philippine army in Marawi City on Mindanao island, the country's solicitor-general said on Friday.

Malaysians and Indonesians were among the "foreign Jihadists" fighting with the Islamic State-linked Maute group, Solicitor General Jose Calida told a news conference.

"Before it was just a local terrorist group. But now they have subscribed to the ideology of ISIS (Islamic State). They want to make Mindanao as part of the caliphate," he said.
