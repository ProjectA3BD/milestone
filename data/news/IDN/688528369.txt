The attacks on Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar are a "textbook example of ethnic cleansing", the United Nations' top human rights official has said, as concerns grow that the conflict threatens regional security.

Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, addressing the UN human rights council in Geneva, said the UN had received multiple reports and satellite imagery of security forces and local militia burning Rohingya villages and "consistent accounts of extrajudicial killings, including shooting fleeing civilians".

"I call on the government to end its current cruel military operation, with accountability for all violations that have occurred, and to reverse the pattern of severe and widespread discrimination against the Rohingya population," he said.

Almost 300,000 distressed Rohingya have fled violence in Rakhine province in the past fortnight, creating what aid agencies say is one of the worst humanitarian crises in Asia for decades.
