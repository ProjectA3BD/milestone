Jakarta: Indonesians who join Islamic State or sympathise with the terrorist group will face criminal sanctions for the first time under draft laws that will significantly harden the country's counter-terrorism legislation.

It follows consultations with Australia and other nations keen for Indonesia to strengthen its approach.

The proposed laws come as Indonesia grapples with a surge in its citizens travelling to Syria and Iraq to fight with Islamic State, with an estimated 500 there, most assigned to their own military unit alongside Malaysian and Singaporean recruits.

As Indonesia is failing to stem the outflow of jihadists, its judges have determined that being a member of Islamic State and undertaking paramilitary training with the militant jihadist group - also known as ISIS or ISIL - is not a crime.
