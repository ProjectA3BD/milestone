SEPANG: The Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 (KLIA2) was abuzz early Tuesday with local and international media gathered outside as court officials visited the scene where Kim Jong-nam was allegedly murdered.

The site visit marks the ninth day of the trial of Indonesian Siti Aisyah, 25, and Vietnamese Doan Thi Huong, 28, who are jointly charged with four others still at large, of killing Jong-nam, 45, at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 (klia2) departure hall at 9am on Feb 13.

Judge Datuk Azmi Ariffin had allowed the defence lawyers' request for a site visit to enable them to identify the location of the incident which was shown in a closed-circuit television (CCTV) at the airport.

To facilitate the site visit, the police had cordoned off a section of the departure terminal, at the self check in counters between the 'V' and 'W' check-in counters.

Although passengers are still able to use the counters, many approached journalists there to ask what was going on or whether a celebrity was expected to arrive.

Dozens of cameramen had been camping in the vicinity since 6am.

Siti and Doan were spotted being brought in under heavy police security at around 8.30am.

Their lawyers, the prosecutors and judge are expected to inspect the departure terminal and the clinic where Jong-nam had sought medical treatment.

Images from CCTV recordings played during the trial showed a woman wearing a "LOL" shirt and approaching Jong-nam at KLIA2.

Jong Nam, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, arrived in Malaysia on Feb 6, and was at the klia2 to board a 9am flight to Macau on the day he was killed.
