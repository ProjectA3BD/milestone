Australian woman Sara Connor stood silently still and closed her eyes as Bali judges sentenced her to four years over the fatal assault of local police officer at Kuta Beach seven months ago.

It’s half of the eight-year term that prosecutors had called for and will include the seven months she has already served.

If she shows good behaviour in Kerobokan prison, her sentence may be reduced further.

But the jail term is nevertheless a heavy blow to the 46-year-old mother who had hoped to be found not guilty and released to go back to her two sons in Byron Bay.

She and her legal team now have seven days to decide whether she will appeal.

Prosecutors will also be weighing up whether they challenge Monday’s decision.

Connor’s lawyer Robert Khuana expressed disappointment at the sentence – which was two years less than the six handed to her British boyfriend David Taylor for the fatal assault in company.

This was despite Taylor being responsible for “90 per cent” of the attack on Mr Sudarsa on the night of August 16 at Kuta Beach, Mr Khuana said.

But in handing down the sentence at Denpasar Court on Monday, Chief Judge Made Pasek found Connor did play a role.

Drawing on their testimony, as well as several witnesses, Taylor, they said, had become embroiled in a fight with Mr Sudarsa after Connor lost her wallet on Kuta Beach.

During the melee, Taylor had hit Mr Sudarsa with his walkie talkie, his binoculars and whacked him across the head with a beer bottle.

Connor, Judge Pasek found, had not simply tried to separate the pair as she claimed throughout their trial.

They found she jumped on Mr Sudarsa’s shoulders, effectively pinning him down during the fight on Kuta Beach.
