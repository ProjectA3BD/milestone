Sunday, June 19, 2016, 1:27 PM - Torrential rains in Indonesia have triggered flooding and landslides, killing at least 35 people.

A further 25 people are missing, according to officials with Indonesia's emergency management organization, in an interview with CNN.

The deaths are reportedly all in the province of Central Java, on Indonesia's post populous island. Landslides claimed 31 of the dead, with the remaining four dying in floods.

The disasters were triggered by torrential rains that drenched the country Saturday. CNN reports that, in one incident, a landslide had blocked a road, and while travellers worked to clear the debris, a second landslide hit several motorcycles that were queued up, killing nine.

Elsewhere in the sprawling archipelago nation, thousands of people fled their homes and one person was killed as heavy rains triggered flooding in Sumatra last week. Sumatra was also the site of a volcanic eruption in May that killed at least seven people.

Indonesia is a mountainous country, where landslides due to heavy rains are not uncommon. One such slide in 2014 killed more than 90 people.
