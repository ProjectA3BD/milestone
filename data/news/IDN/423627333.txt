Bangkok: Malaysia's government has revived a law that allows indefinite detention without charge that critics say could usher in a new wave of repression in the south-east Asian nation.

Parliament's passing of a highly contentious Prevention of Terrorism Act comes amid a crackdown on freedom of speech and civil rights where dozens of people have been arrested under a draconian Sedition Act and face up to five years jail.

The government argues the power to detain terrorism suspects without trial, court challenges or legal representation is necessary to combat the rising threat of extremists drawn to groups such as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
