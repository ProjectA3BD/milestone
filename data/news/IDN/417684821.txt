A MAN facing firearms charges believes Indonesia will overrun Australia, the Bundaberg Magistrates Court has been told.

Russell Douglas Drinkwater, 53, was arrested and charged last week after police allegedly found about 90 firearms and drugs during a search of his Monto property.

He appeared before the court yesterday on a further 10 firearms charges and applied for bail.

Police prosecutor Sergeant Barry Stevens said bail was opposed.

He said Drinkwater was a licensed armourer who made and sold firearms.

Sgt Stevens said Drinkwater allegedly had hidden bunkers on his large property near Monto, and had stockpiles of food and water.

He said Drinkwater allegedly had 92 firearms on his property and 288kg of ammunition.

Defence lawyer Mary Buchanan said Drinkwater had been obsessed with firearms since he was about 15.

She said while he was a hoarder, he posed no danger to the public.

Magistrate Aaron Simpson said Drinkwater had not made any threats to the public.

He granted bail and remanded him to June 11.
