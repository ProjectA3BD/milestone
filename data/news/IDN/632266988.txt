SEPANG: About 10 minutes before the scheduled court proceeding to charge the alleged assassins of Kim Jong-nam, the press corps are gathering outside of the Sepang court complex.

Security in the area is tight, with a heavy police presence, including traffic personnel to control the traffic flow.

Members of the media, who started camping outside the complex as early as 5am, are currently barred from entering.

Upon registering themselves, newsmen have to surrender their gadgets, including their mobile phones, laptops and recorders.

Bags are also being checked before media practitioners are allowed in.

Only two journalists from each news agency are allowed entry.

Currently, hundreds of journalists are still waiting to enter the complex.

It is believed that only a maximum of 15 Malaysian and 15 international organisations - limited to three from each media organisation - will be allowed in.

Police sources also confirmed that 199 police officers and personnel are on duty at the court complex.

The two female suspects, Vietnamese Doan Thi Huong and Indonesian Siti Aisyah, are being charged at the Sepang Sessions Court Wednesday.

The women are alleged to have administered the VX nerve agent that killed Jong-nam, the elder half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.

Duon was arrested on Feb 15 as she tried to catch a flight to Vietnam while Siti Aisyah was nabbed the next day.
