Dozens of suspected illegal Malaysian workers have been swept up in regional NSW raids by immigration agents and federal police.

Among those captured on Monday were 14 "unlawful non-citizens" and 20 "lawful non-citizens" allegedly working in breach of their visa restrictions in the agricultural sector at Woolgoolga, near Coffs Harbour.

A group of 32 adults has been taken to Villawood Immigration Detention Centre in Sydney ahead of their deportation to Malaysia, while two minors are being held elsewhere, Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said.
