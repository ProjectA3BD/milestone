KONTAN.CO.ID - Jakarta Corruption Court judges sentenced former Constitutional Court (MK) justice Patrialis Akbar to eight years in prison at a hearing on Monday.

Reading out the court's final verdict, presiding judge Nawawi Pamolango said the former member of the National Mandate Party (PAN) was proven guilty of accepting bribes from a beef importer in connection with a judicial review on the 2014 Animal Husbandry and Livestock Health Law.

It was reported that Patrialis received US$70,000 in bribes from businessman Basuki Hariman and his secretary, Ng Fenny, through his aide Kamaludin.

Last week, Basuki and Fenny were sentenced respectively to seven and five years behind bars for their roles in the bribery.

Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) prosecutors had asked for 12.5 years of imprisonment and Rp 500 million ($37,486.90) in fines for Patrialis at a hearing two weeks ago.

The prosecutors also required him to return the $10,000 and Rp 4 million he had gained from his crimes.

The corruption court is also scheduled to hand down the sentence for Kamaludin in a separate hearing on Monday. Prosecutors have sought eight years in prison for the middleman.

Patrialis has become the second MK justice to be tried for graft following former chief justice Akil Mochtar, who was found guilty of bribery.

In 2014, the court sentenced Akil to life imprisonment when judges found him guilty of accepting Rp 57 billion in bribes from a number of regional heads. The bribes were intended to influence the Constitutional Court's decision on electoral disputes he had handled.(Kharishar Kahfi)
