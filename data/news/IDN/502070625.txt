Flamingo is launching an office in Jakarta to build on its SEA expertise.

Heading up the Jakarta office will be Adri Reksodipoetro, who is an Indonesian native and outgoing managing director of Flamingo’s APAC hub in Singapore. Prior to this he also worked in various insights agencies in Paris and Sydney.

Flamingo Jakarta will operate as a satellite of the Singapore office, drawing on the expertise and resources of the APAC team to service local Indonesian clients as well as international clients looking to conduct projects in Indonesia. It currently has offices Shanghai, Tokyo and Mumbai. Clients for the Indonesia office currently include Heineken, Disney, Google and Unilever.

Joining Reksodipoetro will be Widad Jamil, formerly of Flamingo Singapore, and new recruit Tamy Rinaldi who will join at launch.

Kirsty Fuller, co-founder of Flamingo Group, said:

“Indonesia has the fourth largest population and one of the fastest growing economies in the world, and demand for Flamingo’s services in Indonesia has increased significantly in the past few years. Our local presence will aim to bring our international expertise and point of view to Indonesia.”

Adri Reksodipoetro, managing director Jakarta:

“We’ve been working in Indonesia for many years out of our Singapore office and I’m excited to bring Flamingo’s blend of cultural insights and strategic thinking back to my hometown. I feel this is the right time to establish ourselves in Indonesia and raise the bar for local research.”
