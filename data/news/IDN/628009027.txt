KUALA LUMPUR, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian police have arrested another suspect in connection with the death of DPRK man, state news agency Bernama reported here Thursday.

Bernama reported that national police chief Khalid Abu Bakar had confirmed the arrest and that an official statement would be issued later.

It is not sure yet whether the suspect is related to the female suspect, who was arrested on Wednesday at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport's second terminal, where the deceased DPRK man once looked for help for feeling unwell on Monday. He died on the way to hospital.

Malaysian police said earlier that the 46-year-old deceased was holding a DPRK passport under the name Kim Chol. His body was taken to a hospital in Kuala Lumpur Wednesday for post mortem to ascertain the cause of his death.
