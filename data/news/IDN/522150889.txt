The Jakarta administration and bus operators have become locked in a disagreement over maximum vehicle age.



The authorities want to limit the age to 10 years, but operators want a graded maximum of between 12 and 20 years depending on the type of bus. A ministerial regulation, meanwhile, sets the limit at 25 years.



City bylaw no. 5/2014 on transportation, which limits the age of small and medium- and full-sized buses allowed to ply the city streets to a maximum of 10 years after production. Small buses refer to mikrolet (public minivans), while medium-sized buses are Metro Mini and Kopaja and full-sized buses include Mayasari Bakti and those operated by city-owned firm PT Transportasi Jakarta (Transjakarta). The

bylaw was issued and took effect in April 2014, and operators were obliged to renew their vehicles within 12 months of the bylaw's issuance.



The limit aims to guarantee public transportation safety and worthiness, as well as curbing corruption relating to vehicle road worthiness (KIR) tests. KIR test officers are widely known to accept bribes from bus drivers in return for declaring their vehicles roadworthy.



Organization of Land Transportation Owners (Organda) chairman Shafruhan Sinungan said that Jakarta's regulation on vehicle operational age was too harsh, calling on the city to revise the limit.



'Ten years is too short a time; we need to collect enough money to procure new buses. We propose the maximum vehicle age be prolonged,' Shafruhan said during a recent meeting at the Jakarta Transportation Agency in Central Jakarta.



Operators, he explained, need at least seven years for a turnover, which leaves just three years for them to gain income and save enough money to procure new vehicles. Ten years, he argued, would not greatly degrade a vehicle.



The latest data from the transportation agency reveal that there are more old than new buses operating in Jakarta.



Of the total 2,444 full-sized buses in Jakarta, 1,277 are more than 10 years old, or around 50 percent of the total fleet. The number of medium-sized buses aged above 10 year is 3,084 of the total 3,295, or about 93.5 percent.



Of the total 13,692 small buses, 6,419 are more than 10 years old.



Shafruhan said that in 2013 operators had initially proposed age limits of 12, 15 and 20 years for small and medium- and full-sized buses, respectively. However, he said, their suggestions were not taken into consideration and the bylaw was approved without further discussion with Organda.



Meanwhile, transportation ministerial regulation no. 98/2013 on minimum service standards for motorized public transportation with designated routes allows operators to operate their vehicles much longer. For example, Mikrolet, Kopaja, Metro Mini and other inner city transportation vehicles may operate up to 20 years, while the limit is 25 years for inter-province vehicles.



Jakarta Transportation Agency head Andri Yansyah said that the bylaw would take months to revise, and that doing so would be unfair on those operators who had already begun to renew their fleets. However, he said, operators could renew their fleets gradually over the course of the next three years.



Jakarta Transportation Council (DTKJ) chairwoman Ellen Tangkundung called on the city to revise the bylaw, saying that minimum service standards for public transportation did not depend on vehicle age. The city should instead improve vehicle road worthiness to ensure public transportation safety, Ellen said.



She said that the 10-year limit was suitable for Transjakarta buses, as the buses operated almost 24 hours a day and were almost always full of passengers, but that it should not be applied indiscriminately to other types of bus.



'Age is not the only factor determining vehicle worthiness. There are many vehicles that under 10 years old but aren't roadworthy, and yet there are vehicles more than 10 years old that still function well,' Ellen said.
