Bangkok: Malaysian authorities say they have foiled a plot by Islamic extremists to detonate a series of bombs across the capital Kuala Lumpur, ahead of a summit of South-East Asian leaders.

Leaders of the 10-member Association of South-East Asian Nations gather in Kuala Lumpur on Monday before moving for further talks on the resort island of Langkawi on Tuesday.

Malaysia wants the leaders to agree on greater co-operation to fight extremism following reports that dozens of Muslims from their countries are fighting in the Middle East.
