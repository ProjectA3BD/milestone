Indonesian court overturns child sex abuse convictions of two international school staff

Updated

Indonesia's high court has overturned the child sex abuse convictions of two staff from an international school with links to the Australian Embassy.

Canadian teacher Neil Bantelman and an Indonesian teacher's aide Ferdinand Tjiong, who worked at the Jakarta International School, were accused of interfering with two young boys.

The South Jakarta District Court had sentenced them to 10 years' jail in April.

At the time the judges dismissed medical records that backed Mr Bantelman's and Mr Tjiong's defence.

Instead, they relied on psychology reports that said the boys appeared to have been traumatised as well as claims Mr Bantelman's did not have enough sex with his wife.

At the time of sentencing in April Ms Bantleman released a statement in support of her husband describing the case as a "malicious make-believe story with a multi-million-dollar price tag".

"The decision of the judges to imprison two innocent men, with no evidence at all is truly cruel, inhumane and heartless," she said.

Following the verdict, Canada called for due process to be followed, Britain noted irregularities in the case, and America warned the outcome could damage Indonesia's reputation abroad.
