Blasts struck at the heart of Jakarta on Thursday, leaving at least seven people dead and 19 injured after suicide bombers and a group of armed men attacked Indonesia's capital city.



The deadly blasts and gun attacks took place on Jl. MH Thamrin, one of Jakarta's busiest streets, located not far from government ministries and the State Palace.



The National Police spokesman Insp. Gen. Anton Charliyan said on Thursday that all five terrorists had died in the attack: two were suicide bombers and the rest died during a shootout with the police.





Your comments:



Indonesia was fortunate as these particular terrorists were inexperienced and poorly trained fighters who only had a few light weapons and some very small bombs. Also Indonesia's 'soft approach' to terrorism has not worked.

Thankfully the terrorists were incompetent, and the deaths of innocents were limited. The situation could have been much worse. Thankfully the police were on the scene and got rid of them quickly. No court cases, no victimhood statements from lefties, just get rid of the bad guys.



Nothing To Do



'There are 1,085 radical groups working underground as recorded by the National Police,' Anton added. Still, police would focus their investigation on which group was linked to the attacks.



You know how many there are underground. I bet you know a lot more but as usual, are sitting on the information waiting for something to happen. Don't focus only on the ones involved in the attacks. Clean them all out. Don't forget the instigators above ground in organizations like the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). Clean out all instigators and haters.

More of the brainwashed idiots died than they managed to kill, which is something. Syria's rejects and amateurs, at best.



So-called Muslims killing and maiming Muslims. IS only appeals to idiots anyway.

I think the Indonesian security forces handled the situation pretty well, which makes your buddies in the US and France look like amateurs.



The True Patriot



Well, the US and Russia surely want to brainwash the world into thinking IS represents the true teachings of Islam. It's up to Indonesia to counter the evil intentions of these foreign powers that seek to humiliate Islam directly.

He refused to say that police were negligent in not anticipating the attacks.



His refusal to say they were negligent, or even rebut claims of their negligence, only confirms the negligence.



Ha, they knew nothing. If it weren't for the FBI and Aussie intel, who knows what tragedy would have happened during the holidays.



The police are utterly clueless and cowardly. Protecting citizens is not something they know; exploiting citizens for money, they are experts at.

With IS having access to enormous financial resources and young impressionable recruits, Indonesia needs to fear the unthinkable.



Pure Papua



Condolences to the families of the two who were tragically lost and a speedy recovery to all injured in this extreme display of cowardice and terrorism.



I sincerely hope nothing like this happens again and that Indonesian Intel and police become more proactive in their fight against radicalism, extremism and terrorism.



This was only one cell of terrorists, many more are still in country and more are becoming radicalized.



The 'soft approach' of eradicating terrorism does not work and blatantly disregards life.



These Da'esh will become bolder and better organized in their attacks.

Imagine the opportunity with worldwide media seeking out and quoting (!) the few English language news outlets ' and the servers of the most famous and reputable one (The Jakarta Post website) are down.



And then all we get next day is an AP copy-paste!



They were scared and shut down office for the day or what happened?



Kantisini





What impact will this have on AB Bashir's case review?



Pherplexed



People in the comments usually bring up 'god'/'religion' in these matters. There's no need to do so because if we all actually read the Koran, it doesn't say anything that's supporting these violent acts done by terrorists.



Please stop being racist and just feel sorry for the people that died. #SaveJakarta #WeAreStrong #WeAreBrave

Indonesia has a big sign hung out at every entry. Welcome terrorist and radicals who use Islam in their names and as their excuse for being. The nation and many of its laws lean toward being a radical organization it seems. Then, the soft approach to terrorism. Sure, you got a freshly grown wild lion in your bedroom. Use the soft approach and get eaten. Same thing.

Wow, you are back. Alhamdulillah. I'm so glad that you are safe, Sir JP! I've been accessing your online site and now you are back. Never feel failure. We are not afraid anymore. We are still brave. It's time to do business here. It's time to forget about the attack. Stay safe! Ya Allah will protect Indonesia. Amen. I've done many prayers.



I'm waiting. Allah will destroy IS soon. IS is not Islamic state but anti-Islamic and a terrorist zone. Allah doesn't like their highly aggressive violence. It is not in the name of Allah but rather Allah has cursed it. Stay safe.



Focus on doing business. Indonesia needs strong business to keep IS from entering here! Keep your spirit!
