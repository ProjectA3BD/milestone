A North Korean man who was released from custody after police found insufficient evidence to charge him over the murder of Kim Jong Nam has been deported from Malaysia, officials said.

Ri Jong Chol was detained four days after the half-brother of North Koreaâ€™s leader was killed at a Malaysian airport.

Police did not say what they thought his role in the killing might have been.

They said Mr Ri would be deported because he had no valid travel document.

Immigration director-general Mustafar Ali said Mr Ri left on a flight from Malaysia, escorted by two North Korean Embassy officials, and that he is banned from re-entering the country.
