With the executions of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran imminent, it is worth reflecting on the impotence, and even complicity of successive Australian governments in the death penalty practices of Asian states like Indonesia and Singapore.

In August 2005, the Indonesian police – acting on information passed onto them by the Australian Federal Police – arrested nine Australians at Denpasar airport for attempting to smuggle heroin. Chan and Sukumaran were among those charged. Since that time many questions have been asked of the AFP as to why, if they had sufficient evidence of the drug importation in this case, didn't they take charge of the arrest in a jurisdiction such as Australia, where the death penalty is not an option.

September a year later, Prime Minister John Howard refused to intervene on behalf of the Bali nine as there were "still matters potentially to be heard before Indonesian courts" and he did not want to jeopardise the defendants' case.

The Rudd/Gillard Labor governments seemed to have been equally reticent to push hard against the death penalty in the Bali nine affair. In May 2013 then Foreign Affairs Minister Bob Carr defended the government's handling of the Chan and Myuran cases. "We urge them (Indonesia) to grant the clemency appeals but we do so having respect with Indonesia to make its own laws," he said.
