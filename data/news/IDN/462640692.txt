At the center of the protest is the graft allegation against Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. Nearly US$700 million were allegedly channeled from state funds to his personal bank accounts.





Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has been embroiled in a scandal involving the state investment fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad since July.





The Wall Street Journal broke the story, that Malaysian investigators had traced nearly US$670 million in deposits to accounts allegedly belonging to the prime minister. According to the report, the two largest deposits, worth US$620 million and US$61 million, were transferred to Najib Razak's account in March 2013 during an election campaign. The cash was reportedly sent through a number of companies linked to 1MDB, which was founded by Najib in 2009 to develop new industries.





It's the first time Malaysia's leader has faced criminal allegations. Najib has slammed the report as "wild allegations" and denies any wrongdoing. On August 3rd, Malaysia's Anti-Corruption Commission said the money in Najib's account was donations from the Middle East. It did not name the donors. Najib said the money was held in trust for his party and was not for his own personal use.





The report also put 1MDB under the spotlight, which has suffered huge losses due to mismanagement, resulting in a debt accumulation of nearly US$12 billion. After the Wall Street Journal report, other media reports suggested a high-profile 2.5 billion joint venture between 1MDB and oil service firm PetroSaudi International was used to syphon billions of dollars from the fund. Meanwhile, Swiss authorities have launched a money-laundering probe against the fund.
