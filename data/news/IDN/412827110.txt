Hong Kong woman gets six years in jail for abusing maid

HONG KONG, Feb. 27 -- A Hong Kong woman was sentenced to six years in prison and fined 15,000 HK dollars (about 1,932.99 U.S. dollars) for abusing her Indonesian domestic helper at the District Court on Friday.

Earlier this month, the woman, Law Wan-tung, 44, was found guilty of 18 of 20 charges including grievous bodily harm, criminal intimidation and failure to pay wages or give time off work to her domestic worker Erwiana Sulistyaningsih.

Handling down the sentence, district Court Judge Amanda Woodcock said Law's attitude and behavior were contemptible, and she had shown no compassion to her domestic helpers.

The judge said this type of conduct could be prevented if domestic helpers were not forced to live with their employers.

The case had gained international attention about a year ago after photos of Erwiana's injuries spread among Indonesians in Hong Kong. From those photos, her face, hands and legs covered with scabs and lacerations. (1 U.S. dollar = 7.76 HK dollars)
