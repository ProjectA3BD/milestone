Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is facing a severe threat for the first time and this time, it's not some superpower aiming at it but a deadly disease. Reports suggest that 16 ISIS terrorists contracted AIDS after having sexual intercourse with two Moroccan women in Syria. The incident took place in al-Mayadeen city and since then there is panic among jihadis. A report published in Morrocoworldnews.com said the infected ISIS men are currently in quarantine.

The two Morrocan women have left for Turkey fearing execution by the ISIS, reports said. Following this, the ISIS leadership has asked all its men to undergo AIDS tests. Reports said that the ISIS leadership is planning to kill AIDS positive militants by sending them out on suicide attacks.

In June, an AIDS-infected jihadi from Indonesia was sentenced to death after he knowingly donated blood to other fighters. He gave the blood to an Egyptian and also to a young Yazidi sex slave who passed it on to Saudi Arabian fighters who had raped the woman. This created panic among the ISIS groups as there were reports that their commander could have also been in the grip of this deadly disease as he had raped the Yazidi slave.
