An Australian man arrested in Bali for allegedly possessing hashish said he didn't know it was a "such a big crime" to use the drug in Indonesia.

Giuseppe "Joe" Serafino, 48, and former Reuters correspondent David Fox were arrested in Sanur last October for allegedly possessing 7.32 grams and 9.83 grams of hashish respectively.

Mr Serafino, who had been living in Bali for the last five years, said he felt pain, was agitated and couldn't sleep if he didn't use hashish, which he mixed with tobacco and smoked like a cigarette.

"I understand now that it is illegal," Mr Serafino told the Denpasar District Court. "But in Australia it was ok. I didn't seek a recommendation from a doctor because I don't speak Indonesian and didn't know the system. I promise not to use it again."
