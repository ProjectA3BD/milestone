An anonymous letter has been sent to the Indonesian consulate in Sydney, threatening a vicious acid attack, apparently on Indonesian citizens in Australia in retaliation for the executions of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.

Staff at the consulate in Maroubra received the threat on Tuesday afternoon and immediately contacted the Australian Federal Police and local police.

The letter, which had no signature or return address, threatened to inflict serious wounds on Indonesians in response to the executions of the Bali nine ringleaders last month, a representative for the consulate said.

It is understood the two-paragraph message, written in incomplete English, made the threat against Indonesian boys in the eastern suburbs.

NSW Police confirmed an investigation is underway.

"They intend to inflict wounds, to hurt in a horrible, serious way. It is quite worrying," the consulate spokesman said.

"It has created a strong feeling of insecurity and fear among the Indonesian community here," he said, referring to the consulate staff.

The anonymous writer called the executions of the drug smugglers a barbaric act.

The consulate was used to receiving abusive messages in response to Indonesia's decision to execute the Australians, but this latest threat was deemed more serious because of the specific intentions outlined by its author, the spokesman said.
