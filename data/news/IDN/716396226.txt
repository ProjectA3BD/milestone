COBRA BITE: Aril died just hours after posting a picture of his snake bite on WhatsApp

The boy, named only as Aril, was bitten on the arm by his venomous snake pet while trying to take a picture of it.

Frantically, the 14-year-old tried to stop the spread of a venom by wrapping a shoelace round his arm before sending a message asking for help.

Moments before he had uploaded a picture of his cobra – captioned “why not smile a little” – after he had given it a bath at around 10am.

Chillingly, the snake has its hood flared in the picture – the telltale sign its about the strike.

Reportedly, the boy then posted a second picture with blood on his arm with the caption “between life and death”.

He then wrote again “please take me to hospital” – but it was too late, and he was declared dead at 10pm.
