YANGON, May 26 (Bernama) -- Myanmar will repatriate 200 Bangladeshi refugees to their homeland under an agreement between the two countries, Xinhua news agency reports quoting official media.

The refugees or 'boat people' were putting up at relief camps in Ale Thankyaw village of Maungtaw in western Rakhine state and originated from Cox's Bazar, Chittagong and northern Dhaka.

The Bangladeshis were planning to seek jobs in Thailand and Malaysia. Another eight refugees are Bengalis from Rakhine state.

Myanmar navy intercepted two fishing trawlers off the western coast ofMaungtaw last Thursday with one carrying 208 people on board and the other without any passengers.

Investigation by the Myanmar government revealed a number of the refugees had fallen victim to human trafficking rings and crime syndicates after receiving job offers in Thailand and Malaysia.

Myanmar's immigration authorities had recently repatriated 11 Bangladeshi nationals who drifted to shore near Oodaung village in Maungtaw after being forced to leave their boat bound for Malaysia.
