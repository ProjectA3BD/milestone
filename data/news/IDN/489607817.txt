THIS is not the news to read while you eat, particularly if you're eating sausages.

An Indonesian man has delivered a bizarre and terrifying punishment on another man he believed had raped his wife.

Rudi Efendi allegedly killed the man after discovering he had supposedly raped his wife Nuriah.

He and his wife, according to police, killed the alleged rapist and set fire to his car.

But this was not the end of their violence.

According to police, when Rudi was arrested he confessed not only to killing the suspected rapist, but also cutting off his genitals.

He took the penis home and fried it.

"Then I ate his 'vital tool'" , he told local media, saying it was a way for him to soothe himself.

"I ate it to heal my heartache towards the victim," he said.

It appears that Rudi discovered his wife was not a virgin after they married.

Nuriah accused the now murdered man -- who she had previously dated -- of raping her a week before her wedding.

Police believe Nuriah helped Rudi meet with the victim, where Rudi stabbed him, mutilated his body, set the car alight then went home to cook his shocking souvenir.

Rudi has said his wife had no part in the slaying.
