Fake news about Indonesia's omnipresent bogeyman - communism - has been blamed for a riot in Central Jakarta that injured five police officers and damaged vehicles in the early hours of Monday morning.

Police were forced to fire tear gas and water cannons to disperse anti-communist protesters who began to pelt police with water bottles and stones and attempted to force their way into the offices of the Jakarta Legal Aid Institute.

A weekend seminar on the 1965 anti-communist purge - a dark chapter in Indonesia's history that remains extremely sensitive today - had already been banned by police on the grounds the organisers had not applied for a permit.

But this did not stop crowds chanting "Crush the PKI" (the now defunct Indonesian communist party) and surrounding the institute building.
