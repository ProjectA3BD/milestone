JAKARTA, Indonesia - According to the tax office, Google Indonesia paid 0.1 percent taxes on the total income with the value-added taxes it owed in 2015.

Indonesia has reportedly decided to launch a probe into Google’s back taxes from the last five years.

A senior tax official was quoted in reports as saying that the search engine giant could face over $400 million bill for last year alone if it is found to have evaded tax payments.

The tax office head of the special cases branch, Muhammad Hanif, said that officials had visited Google’s local office on Monday in Indonesia.

Reports pointed out that a majority of the revenue made in the country is booked in Singapore at Google’s Asia-Pacific headquarters.

The tax office was prompted to escalate this into a criminal case as the audit for the month of June was declined by Google Asia Pacific, Hanif said.

He further stated, “Google’s argument is that they just did tax planning. Tax planning is legal, but aggressive tax planning - to the extent that the country where the revenue is made does not get anything - is not legal.”

In response to Hanif’s comments, Google Indonesia replied in a statement and said that it continues to run with the local authorities and has legally paid all the applicable taxes.

For 2015, Google’s tax bill with fines could be around 5.5 trillion rupiahs, as per Hanif's estimation. However, he declined to offer an estimate for the last 5-year time period.

Hanif further stated that the tax office will chase back taxes from various companies which provide content using the internet in Indonesia.
