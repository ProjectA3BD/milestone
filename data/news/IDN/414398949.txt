Indonesian diplomats have told a global human rights summit that a moratorium on the death penalty could be reintroduced - just as the country prepares to execute drug criminals, including Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.

The Indonesian comments in Geneva on Wednesday came after the UN's top human rights official called for a global ban on the death penalty, warning the practice of killing prisoners too often targeted "foot soldiers" and not kingpins of the illegal drugs trade.

With Indonesian diplomats sitting among representatives of more than 24 countries gathered for a "high-level panel" at the Human Rights Council, UN assistant secretary-general Ivan Simonovic said capital punishment was "inhuman and outdated" and there was no evidence that executions stop crimes.

He also warned of mistakes and abuses where the death penalty had been imposed, the UN news service reports.

Mr Simonovic did not mention the case of the Bali nine pair - awaiting execution on an Indonesian prison island - or single out any individual country in his remarks on Wednesday.
