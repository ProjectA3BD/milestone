SERIAN: A total of 13 illegal immigrants had been prosecuted at the Semuja Sessions Court here.

Disclosing this in a press statement yesterday, Kuching Immigration Department prosecutor Ibrahim Zaini said four were charged in Court following an in-depth probe by their investigation unit in Sri Aman and Kuching.

The arrests were made in Sri Aman Division and here and one accused was arrested at the Kuching International Airport.

In the first case, two persons were sentenced to four months’ jail and one whipping each after they were convicted under

Section 6(1)(c) of the Immigration Act 1959/1963 for entering the country without a valid travel pass. Meanwhile, in the second case, an Indonesian was found guilty under the same section for committing the same offence and was sentenced to four months behind bars. Due to his young age, the court spared him the whipping. However, seven other illegal immigrants who were prosecuted together with him and were also from Indonesia were sentenced to four months’ jail and a whipping each for the similar offence.

In the third case, two Indonesian men who were arrested in Sri Aman were sentenced to two months’ jail for overstaying in the country.

Lastly, an accused who was arrested at the Kuching International Airport was sentenced to four months’ jail for letting his travel pass to be used by someone else. They all served the custodial sentence at Sri Aman prison.
