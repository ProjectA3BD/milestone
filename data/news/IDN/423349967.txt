MALAYSIA'S national police chief says 17 people detained over the weekend for a suspected Islamic militant plot had planned to kidnap high-profile figures and launch terrorist attacks.

KHALID Abu Bakar said the plotters arrested on Sunday were believed to have been inspired by the extremist Islamic State (IS) group and its bloody jihad in Syria and Iraq.
