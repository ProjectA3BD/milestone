IGP Khalid Abu Bakar tweeted that the Sarawak Report claim of charge sheet against PM Najib was false.

KUALA LUMPUR, July 31 (MySinchew) -- IGP Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar (@KBAB51) tweeted that the Sarawak Report claim of the issuance of charge sheet against Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak was false.

He urged the public not to disseminate rumors, saying the report from unidentified source was meant to confuse the public.

It was said that the issuance of charge sheet against the PM was the reason behind the termination of former attorney-general Tan Sri Abdul Gani Patail.

After his first tweet, Khalid tweeted again after more than an hours, this time quoting Deputy Solicitor General I Datuk Tun Abd Majid Tun Hamzah to prove his claim.

"The draft of the charge that was published by Sarawak Report was not made or issued by the Attorney-General's Chambers," Tun Majid said via his Twitter handle @TAMajid.
