A SURVIVOR of a jungle camp claims Rohingya refugees fleeing Myanmar were buried in a town grave under the noses of Thai and Malaysian authorities.

THE young man known as Buraq, whose name has been changed, told ABC TV the bodies were brought off the mountain jungles so the trafficker could avoid having them found at his camp.
