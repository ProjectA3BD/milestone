Cilacap is in the news again as journalists gather in the Indonesian port town.

It's on the southern coast of Java, nowhere near Bali. Intrepid Australian surfers who ride the waves on Java's treacherous southern coast may know it. The rest of us have heard of it because people have climbed into boats there on their way to Australia.

It was a holiday somewhere off the beaten track, and we stayed several days, chilling out and going for walks in the forested peninsula, a national park.
