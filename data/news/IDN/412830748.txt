A woman was on Friday sentenced to six years in prison and fined HK$15,000 (about $1,932.99) for abusing her Indonesian domestic.

Earlier this month, the woman, Law Wan-tung, 44, was found guilty of 18 of 20 charges including grievous bodily harm, criminal intimidation and failure to pay wages or give time off work to her domestic worker Erwiana Sulistyaningsih.

Handling down the sentence, district court Judge Amanda Woodcock said Law's attitude and behaviour were contemptible, and she had shown no compassion to her domestic helpers, Xinhua reported.

The judge said this type of conduct could be prevented if domestic helpers were not forced to live with their employers.

The case had gained international attention about a year ago after photos of Erwiana's injuries spread among Indonesians in Those photos showed her face, hands and legs covered with scabs and lacerations.
