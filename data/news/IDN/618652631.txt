A British former war correspondent has gone on trial in Indonesia charged with possessing hashish on the resort island of Bali.

David Fox, who worked for US news agency Reuters, was arrested in October along with Australian Giuseppe Serafino.

Police confiscated a total of 10.09g (0.36oz) of hashish from Fox's clothing and house.

The 55-year-old is on trial at the Denpasar District Court, where prosecutor Erawati Susina said on Thursday that he could face a maximum four years in prison.

Police said Fox told them he had used the drug for years to overcome stress caused by covering conflicts.

Indonesia has extremely strict drug laws and convicted smugglers are often executed. About 150 people are on death row, mostly for drug crimes.
