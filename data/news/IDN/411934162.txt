Indonesian President Joko Widodo Tuesday said there will be no postponement of the executions of 11 convicts on death row, most of them on drug charges.

Widodo also warned foreign countries not to intervene in his country's law enforcement, Xinhua news agency reported.

The president noted that he had refused to give mercy to 64 convicts, including the 11 persons, as drug trafficking has posed a threat to the country.

Mercy pleas have been repeatedly appealed by Australia, Brazil and France, whose citizens are among those to face the capital punishment.

"The first thing that I need to say firmly is that there shouldn't be any intervention in the death penalty because it is our sovereignty on law, our sovereignty on politics," the president said at the State Palace.

Separately, a court in Jakarta Tuesday rejected an appeal by two Australian citizens, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, who are among the 11 convicts, against the president's rejection of their request for clemency.

Indonesian Attorney General H.M. Prasetyo said that the preparations have been made for the executions of the 11 convicts.
