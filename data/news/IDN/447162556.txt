There is something wrong with every part of the country. The Igbos are involved in drug trafficking and smuggling in Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia; the Yorubas are involved in Yahoo Yahoo and juju pedling, the Hausa are involved in religious fanatism and killings of "infidels", the Binis are hell bent on travelling abroad even if it means crossing the dreaded Mediterranean sea......e.t.c Every ethnic group has smting wrong with it. If only the country was wrking as it ought to. But for the greediness and corruption of Babaginda, Obasanjo, Jonathan and all those that have been part of their govt at one point in time or the other; we are whr we are today. PMB pls distinguish urself from this lot and give us d change u promised; else history would add u to d bunch listed above.

Please no one should blame our govt for this, this issue is beyond govt, I think it has to do with individuals and families, untill some people realize that success is from God, not how far you push yourself, if you acquired wealth through illegal means that is not a success,its suffering and survival, some people in this part of the country want to acquire wealth any how just to flex and oppress their kingmen come December, this act is really pushing them to do anything to be rich before going back to the village, so the issue is a family issue not govt because while some of them are bad I hav lots of them as friends here doing their legit business and making cool cash, it only the greedy ones.



Families from this tribes should take pressure off their children, cos we all work in Nigeria to survive its only God that make one rich in my country, unless you are a politicians or relate to one, you are business man in oil and gas sectors, you are working wit one of the telecom. The rest it is not easy. Mama and papa pls leave them alone, stop comparison between your children and others, manage the little they can afford to give you for now, if you don't want them to die young. 38 Likes 5 Shares
