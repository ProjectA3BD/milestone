A former British banker charged with the gruesome murders of two Indonesian women in Hong Kong has pleaded not guilty to murder.

Rurik Jutting denied the murder charges as he went on trial in Hong Kong, but admitted the less charge of manslaughter.

Prosecutors at the High Court refused to accept his plea, meaning the trial on the murder charges will proceed.

The Cambridge graduate, who worked for Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, is accused of killing domestic workers Sumarti Ningsih and Seneng Mujiasih in 2014.

Their bodies were found in his upscale apartment near the Asian financial centre's Wan Chai red-light district.

One of the victim's bodies was found inside in a suitcase left on a balcony, while the other had knife wounds on her neck and buttock, according to initial police reports.

He has pleaded guilty to a third charge of unlawful burial of Sumarti Ningsih's body.
