Story highlights Prosecutor says torture of murder victim was filmed on his iPhone

Women's bodies found in Jutting's upscale apartment

Hong Kong (CNN) It's the grisly double murder that shocked Hong Kong -- two Indonesian women found dead in the upscale apartment of a former British banker, one stuffed into a suitcase on the balcony.

Prosecuters allege 31-year-old Rurik Jutting brutally killed the two women, one of whom he tortured for days, while filming videos on his iPhone.

Prosecutors claimed the British man had tortured and humiliated one of the two women for three days before cutting her throat, describing the case as "horrible" and "shocking."

The prosecution told the jury the phone videos were so gruesome they will be shown to the jury in a separate room, out of sight of the public gallery.

The murder case took two years to come to trial due to the sheer volume of evidence. Hong Kong is normally considered one of the safest cities in the world.
