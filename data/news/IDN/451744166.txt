The federal government is set to end a boycott on ministerial visits to Indonesia.

Justice Minister Michael Keenan will be the first Australian minister to visit Jakarta since the executions of convicted drug smugglers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.

Mr Keenan, who was appointed the first minister for counter terrorism back in May, is heading to Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore next month to advance cooperation in that area.

"Our collective efforts to combat terrorism is our best defence," Mr Keenan will say in a speech to the Lowy Institute in Sydney on Friday.

There is a need for countries in the region to stand together to develop shared strategies for combating terrorist acts and propaganda, he will say.

Australia is seeking to increase information sharing, improve international crime cooperation and border management as well as discuss ways to combat radicalisation via social media.

Like Australia, Indonesia is also grappling with the extremist threat and with an estimated 500 citizens leaving to fight for Islamic State in the Middle East.

Indonesia's vice president Jusuf Kalla believes the spread of Islamic State ideology and recruitment of Indonesians is a threat to the country's sovereignty.
