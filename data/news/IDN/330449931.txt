SINGAPORE - MV Swift Rescue of the Singapore navy picked up a black bag from the navy's RSS Valour early Sunday morning.

Among the items in the bag were personal items of victims from the doomed AirAsia flight QZ8501, said officers on board MV Swift Rescue, a submarine support and rescue vessel. They were recovered by the missile corvette RSS Valour at about 1.15am on Sunday.

One of the items was a child's life jacket from the still missing aircraft. There were three other pieces of personal items. An orange fast rescue craft from MV Swift Rescue was deployed to RSS Valour to retrieve the bag from the vessel which was on its way back to Singapore.

MV Swift Rescue is making arrangements to hand over the items to the Indonesian authorities.
