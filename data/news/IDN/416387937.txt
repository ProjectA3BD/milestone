BALI, Indonesia (AP) — An American woman charged with premeditated murder in the death of her mother on Indonesia’s Bali island has told a court her boyfriend killed her mother in anger after she threatened to kill their unborn baby.

Heather Mack, 19, and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, are being tried separately by Denpasar District Court.

They are charged with murdering Sheila von Wiese-Mack in August at the St. Regis hotel on Bali and face possible death by firing squad if found guilty.

In her first court questioning Wednesday, Mack said Schaefer beat her mother with a metal soup bowl after von Wiese-Mack made the threat in an argument. Von Wiese-Mack objected to their relationship.

Mack, who is eight months’ pregnant, answered “no” when the judge asked whether she wished her mother dead.
