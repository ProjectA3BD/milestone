The Dasilvas’ arrest caused a stir on social media, with many people expressing little sympathy for the couple. “It’s best to stay dressed when visiting people’s sacred spaces, no?” tweeted Greg Holman, a reporter for the Springfield News-Leader in Missouri.

San Diego Gay and Lesbian News publisher Johnathan Hale said he was “embarrassed” by the commentary the Dasilvas’ story had inspired.

“There were comments which showed no concern for Travis’ and Joseph’s well-being,” he said.
