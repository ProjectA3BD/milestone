A combined team of police, soldiers and volunteers searched the house and found 742 speed spills hidden beneath the roof. Other documents about money transfers also were seized.

The couple have been charged with drug possession with intent to sell.

The raid, led by Uthai district chief Sirichai Amphawa, followed complaints that the Mrs Oraya, the village chief known as Phuyai Paeng was a supplier of illicit drugs in the tambon.
