Three Australian members of the Hells Angels motorcycle gang have been arrested and charged with multiple offences in Thailand, with local authorities alleging their involvement "in the murder and secret burial of an Australian two years ago."



The men, who are yet to be identified, were arrested alongside a Canadian national on Wednesday, in the Thai tourist district of Pattaya. All four men are aged between 32 and 42.

It remains unclear what charges have been laid, however it is said they are related to their alleged involvement in "extortion, money laundering, illicit drugs and human trafficking."

Acting deputy commissioner of tourist police Pol Maj Gen Surachet Hakpal, told local media the men "were disguised as tourists and threatened national security."

He also alleged they were "the same group of people involved in the murder and secret burial of an Australian two years ago," referring to the violent killing and burial of alleged Hells Angels drug kingpin Wayne Schneider in 2015.
