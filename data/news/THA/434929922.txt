Mark Caleo, the man accused of masterminding the stabbing death of his wife Rita Caleo and the shooting death of her brother Michael Chye 25 years ago, has been denied bail.

Dr Chye, 36, was shot three times gangland-style as he drove his Mercedes into the garage of his house in Attunga Street, Woollahra, on October 16, 1989, and died of his injuries.
