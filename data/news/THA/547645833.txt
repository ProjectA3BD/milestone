Bangkok, June 6 (IANS) A court in Thailand sentenced four men to two years in prison for a vicious assault on a British couple in their 60s and their 43-year-old son that left them unconscious.

Lewis and Rosemary Owen, aged 68 and 65, were visiting the beachside resort town of Hua Hin with their son, Lewis, for Thai New Year celebrations when several men attacked them on April 13, the Guardian reported on Monday.

Hua Hin provincial court sentenced the Thai men on Sunday to four years in prison but reduced the jail term by two years after the accused confessed.

The assault was largely unreported until CCTV footage was released to the public in late April, focusing international attention on Thailand.

The video showed a brutal assault as the family are set upon, with their attackers repeatedly punching the trio and kicking them in the face even after they were knocked to the ground.

The son and father both received stitches and Rosemary spent several days in hospital after undergoing surgery when doctors found brain swelling.
