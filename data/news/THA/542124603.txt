Bangkok: Inspired by the Philippines' tough-talking president-elect Rodrigo Duterte, the mayor of one of the country's largest cities is offering a bounty for each criminal killed.

Tomas Osmena, mayor of central Cebu City, declared he does not care if the bounty encourages vigilantism in the island-nation where crime has doubled in recent years.

"I will not compromise the safety of my people. I will defend them. I don't care who gets in the way," Mr Osmena said after paying the equivalent of US$1080 ($1490) to a policeman who shot and wounded two alleged fleeing robbers.
