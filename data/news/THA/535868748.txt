WARNING: Distressing

MORE shame has been heaped on Thailand this week after a video emerged showing a gang of men beating up a young woman.

The footage shows the disgusting thugs riding up to the woman on scooters before punching and kicking her in the head in the middle of a busy road.

The woman, believed to be aged 20, turns away and tries to protect herself but the men repeatedly attack her, The Sun reports.

At one point she tries to stumble back to her place of work — a karaoke bar in Thonburi, Bangkok — but the vile brutes pursue her and continue kicking her.

A cowardly onlooker sees what’s happening before getting up from his chair and walking away as the helpless victim endures more violence.

Curled on the ground, two men continue to kick her and stamp on her while the other bystanders in the busy street walk on by.

The woman, believed to be a migrant from the neighbouring country of Laos, is thought to have slept with a married man.

Instead of confronting her husband, it is understood that the wife hired the gang to beat up the young woman.

Although published yesterday, it is believed the footage was recorded sometime in the last few months.

The young woman reportedly suffered multiple injuries to her head, eyes, body and a broken figure.

Two days ago, a British family spoke about how they had been set upon by a gang of Thai men on April 17 during a holiday to the beach resort of Hua Hin.

They have vowed never to return to the country.
