A Thai military court has started the trial of two foreigners charged with the bombing of a popular shrine in Bangkok's center a year ago that killed 20 people and injured more than 120.

The defendants â€” two ethnic Uighurs of Chinese nationality - were driven straight into the military court building Tuesday.

The bombing on Aug. 17, 2015, was one of the deadliest acts of violence in Thailand in decades. It went off at the Erawan shrine, popular among Chinese and other tourists, in the center of Bangkok.

The two men have pleaded not guilty, and at a recent pre-trial appearance they broke down in tears alleging mistreatment by Thai authorities. They are the only two men in custody out of the 17 people that authorities say were responsible.
