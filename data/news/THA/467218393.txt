Bangkok: Thai police now say the perpetrators of last month's deadly bombing in central Bangkok are international human-traffickers linked to militant Uighurs, a Muslim minority in western China.

They say the perpetrators struck out to avenge Thailand's deportation of 109 Uighurs to China in July and its efforts to dismantle their underground network.

"They got angry," said national police chief Somyot Poompanmuang, in his most explicit comments on the motive behind the blast at a shrine on August 17 that killed 20 people and injured more than 120.
