THAI police issued an arrest warrent for a "foreign man" in connection with the Bangkok bomb, as authorities offer a million-Baht reward for information related to the mystery individual pictured in a sketch on Wednesday.

Two days after the attack on the Hindu Erawan shrine in central, downtown Bangkok on Monday evening, police authorities have widened the search, admitting the individual suspect first pictured on Tuesday may be "part of a network" that planned and planted the pipe bomb that killed at least 20 people and injured more than 100.

Police have now issued a court approved arrest warrant for a "a foreign man, unnamed, according to the sketch". Police spokesperson Prawut Thawornsiri claimed the suspect could be of "mixed origin".

On Tuesday CCTV footage and stills were released that appeared to show a young man, wearing a yellow t-shirt and heavy framed glasses, depositing a rucksack on a bench by the shrine before disappearing into the crowd just minutes before the explosion.

Thai police have said two further men - also seen on CCTV footage around the shrine in the lead-up to the explosion - are suspected of involvement in the attack. Details around the two unidentified men have not been released.

Local authorities have appealed for anyone with information surrounding the alleged bomber to come forward, offering a reward of one million Baht (the national currency) - equivalent to roughly AUD$40,000.

The announcement of On Wednesday, the national chief of police Somyot Poompanmoung said he did not believe the attacker was acting alone, telling reporters he was part of a "network".

"I am confident that there are Thais involved but I am not saying it is just Thais or that there are foreigners," he said.

The police chief also told reporters: "I don't suspect one person, I suspect many people".

Meanwhile, the shrine has reopened and local residents have left tributes to the 20 people killed around the popular holy place.
