Mau is also head of the PetroVietnam Accounting and Audit Department.

The agency also took legal proceedings against former head of the PetroVietnamâ€™s management board for electricity and oil and gas project Thai Binh 2 Vu Hong Chuong; chief accountant of the management board for electricity and oil and gas project Thai Binh 2 Tran Van Nguyen; and former Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of the PetroVietnam Construction Corporation (PVC) Nguyen Ngoc.

They were found guilty of violating financial regulations in the Thai Binh 2 thermal power plant project.

The investigation found that though a bidding contract on engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) for the project was yet to be signed, PetroVietnam transferred US$8.2 million and more than VND1.317 trillion (US$57.26 million) to the management board for the power project, which later advanced US$6.6 million and VND1.312 trillion to PVC, causing a loss of more than VND51.7 billion and over US$66,000 in interest until the EPC contract took effect on October 11, 2011.
