A trip to Bangkok (Thailand) is not complete without paying a visit to the marvellous Grand Palace. Built in 1782 after the ascendance of King Rama I, the palace houses royal residence and a number of glittering temples or 'mondops'.

With a wall length of about two kilometres, the palace also houses the Royal Monastery of the Emerald Buddha. The jade Buddha statue, placed on about a two-storey high glittering altar, in itself has a fascinating lost-and-found tale. The inner walls of this monastery, which attract a very large number of visitors from Thailand and outside, have stories of Buddhist legends depicted in colourful murals. (You are not allowed to take pictures inside the monastery.)

The palace also houses museums of ancient weapons and (queen's) textiles.

The gallery also has a picture of soldiers changing guard at the palace.

Just behind the palace, you can see the gigantic metallic Buddha statue. Wat Pho (the temple of Reclining Buddha, with the right hand supporting his head as he reclines) is over 40 metre long and 15 metre high.

The locals say that this place is also home for the formal education in the popular Thai massage.
