Police peacefully ended an anti-government protest by activists at Victory Monument on Wednesday and took 16 of them into custody at Phaya Thai station.

Members of the New Democracy Movement and the Resistant Citizen group organised the protest for 6pm at the monument. The protest, which involved them standing still, was in reaction to the authorities' decision to arrest 10 people in Bangkok and Khon Kaen earlier on Wednesday for posting anti-government messages online.

Police surrounded them and took 16 of them, including human rights lawyer Anon Nampa, to the police station.

Pol Col Chanawin Puangpet, the police station chief, told them at the monument to stop the protest as permission had not been sought in advance. He then ordered officers to take the protestors to Phaya Thai station for detention.
