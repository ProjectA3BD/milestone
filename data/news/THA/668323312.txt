Yangon: Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia torched nearly US$1bil (RM4.3bil) worth of seized narco­tics, in a defiant show of force as police struggle to stem the rising flow of drugs in the region.

The burnings, to mark the UN’s World Anti-Drugs Day, follow ano­ther year of record seizures of narcotics from the remote borderlands of Myanmar, Laos, southern China and northern Thailand.

Myanmar in particular remains one of the world’s great drug-producing nations, a dark legacy of decades of civil war in its frontier regions where troops and ethnic rebel forces have vied for control of the lucrative trade.

Armed gangs churn out vast quantities of opium, heroin and cannabis and millions of caffeine-laced methamphetamine pills known as yaba which are then smuggled out across South-East Asia.

An estimated US$385mil (RM1.6bil) was burnt in three official ceremonies around Myanmar yesterday, according to a senior police officer in Naypyidaw.

At the biggest bonfire in Yangon, huge clouds of smoke filled the sky as authorities set fire to stacks of opium, heroin, cocaine and metham­phetamine tablets worth almost US$230mil (RM985mil).

“We burnt a record amount of drugs today ... because police have seized more in recent years,” drug enforcement officer Myo Kyi said.

On an industrial estate on the outskirts of Bangkok, Thai authorities incinerated some US$589mil (RM2.5bil) worth of drugs including 7,800kg of yaba pills and 1,185kg of crystal methamphetamine.

And in Cambodia, officials burned 130kg of drugs estimated to be worth some US$4mil (RM17mil).

The huge seizures are often touted as proof these countries are ma­king inroads into the vast regional drug trade. — AFP
