ACP Che Ghazali said the man was suspected to be a drug trafficker and that he would be investigated under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act which provides for the mandatory death sentence upon conviction.

“As for possession of the firearm, he would be investigated under Section 8 of the Firearms (Increased Penalties) Act which provides for a maximum of 14 years imprisonment and six strokes of the cane upon conviction,” he said.

A preliminary investigation indicated that the drugs, which totalled RM25,000 in value, were for distribution in Langkawi, he said, adding that the police would try to unearth the distribution network.
