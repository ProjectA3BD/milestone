The family of a British tourist who was raped and murdered while in Thailand has claimed authorities told them, ‘Why are you so bothered? Go home and make another one’.

Hannah Witheridge, 23, was raped and murdered on the island of Koh Tao in September 2014. David Miller, who she was travelling with, was also murdered.

In a Facebook post, Hannah’s sister Laura criticised Thai authorities for their handling of the case and their treatment of the family. She claims police told her family, ‘Why are you so bothered? Just go home and make another one.’

‘Why are you making such a fuss, she will be back in 30 days as something else, she may have better luck next time,’ Laura recalls them saying.

Laura goes on to say that there have been a number of ‘suspicious deaths’ on Koh Tao, many of which were, ‘where possible, covered up as suicides and accidents.’

‘This would have happened with Hannah, if it had not been for the hideous brutality of her passing,’ she writes.

Laura said she had received death threats and received graphic crime scene photographs from Thai nationals, the Independent reports.

There have been allegations that Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo, the two men found guilty of murdering Hannah and David, were tortured into their confessions.

Thai police deny the claim.
