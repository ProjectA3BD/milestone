The Bureau of Customs (BOC) yesterday filed a P31.2-million suit against two firms based in Cagayan de Oro for allegedly smuggling some 780,000 kilos of rice from Thailand.

Elmer dela Peña, owner of EC Peninsula Commercial, and Michael Anguay Abella of New Dawn Enterprises were named respondents in the case filed with the Department of Justice, said BOC chief John Sevilla.

The sacks of rice, which arrived last December at the Cagayan de Oro port, were in 30 shipping containers and were declared as kitchenware and tiles.

The respondents were charged for failing to obtain import permits from the National Food Authority and false declaration of the shipments.

Sevilla said the illegal importation affected farmers as he noted that 780,000 kilos approximates the output by 350 farmers for one planting season.

It was the second time that the BOC filed smuggling charges against the two firms, Sevilla said.

The first case was filed last January for the alleged illegal import of over 1.3 million kilos of glutinous rice worth P82.68 million.

The shipment arrived at the Cagayan de Oro Port in November last year.

Sevilla said they are considering canceling the two firms’ permit to import goods, although he said they have yet to review the move.

He said they would check if the EC Peninsula and the New Dawn Enterprises have other shipments to import.
