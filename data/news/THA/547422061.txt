Four vicious thugs who left an elderly British couple and their son in hospital after a savage and unprovoked attack in Thailand have been jailed, it was reported.

Lewis and Rosemary Owen and their son were beaten unconscious when the drunken gang attacked them in Hua Hin during the Thai New Year celebrations in April.

Mrs Owen, then 65, was left with brain damage while her husband, 68, and son, also named Lewis, 43, needed stitches for head injuries, their dreadful beating captured on CCTV.

Their attackers have been jailed for the brutal attack, the Bangkok Post said.

Suphatra Baithong and Yingyai Saengkham-in, both aged 32, and Siwa Noksri and Chaiya Jaiboon, both 20, were each sentenced to four years in prison.

But their jail terms were halved as they confessed, meaning each man will serve just two years.

Mr and Mrs Owen, who live in Wenvoe in South Wales, have been regular visitors to Thailand since the 1980s.

Neighbours said they have friends there and would often take presents over from the UK.

But on April 13 they were savagely attacked as they made their way back to an apartment they were staying in, apparently after Lewis accidentally bumped into one of the defendants.

Thai police later released video footage of the assault in a bid to trace the suspects - however officers refused to show the Owens the clip because it was "too violent".

The video showed the mother, father and son being punched to the ground before being repeatedly kicked and stamped on as they lay helpless.

Mrs Owen needed an operation to ease swelling on her brain while her 68-year-old husband sustained heavy bruising, two black eyes and needed six stitches in his forehead.

Their son also had 16 stitches to his head. Speaking after the attack he said: "We had never seen the guys before we left the bar we were in. It was just out of the blue."
