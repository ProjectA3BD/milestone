HAT YAI, Thailand - Police say gunmen in southern Thailand killed an 8-year-old boy, his parents and a relative when they shot at a truck carrying the family to a school.

The attack happened Thursday in Narathiwat, one of three southern provinces where Muslim separatists have been fighting a long-running insurgency in this predominantly Buddhist nation. About 7,000 people have been killed since the conflict escalated in 2004.

Police have not identified the attackers, but the violence casts a shadow over recent peace talks. Thailand's government says it's close to reaching an agreement with separatists to create a safe zone in the area.

Police Colonel Kreangsak Gomolsawan says that Somchai Thongchan, 47, was driving to a school when the gunmen opened fire. Somchai, his wife, sister-in-law and 8-year old son were killed.
