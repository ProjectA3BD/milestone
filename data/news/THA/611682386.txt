Bhubaneswar, Dec 25 : Orissa Stevedores Ltd (OSL) Managing Director Mahimananda Mishra and Executive Director Basant Bal have been taken into custody in Bangkok for their alleged involvement in a murder case in Paradip, police said on Sunday.

The Bangkok immigration police have detained them following a request by Odisha Police.

"Mahimananda Mishra and Bal have been detained at the immigration centre in Bangkok on the request of Odisha Police. A team of police has already left for Thailand to bring them back to the state. They will be arrested formally on reaching Odisha," DGP K.B. Singh told reporters here.

He said steps were being taken to deport them back to India.

They were charged with murdering Mahendra Swain, General Manager of Hyderabad-based Seaways Shipping and Logistics Limited (SSLL), over an alleged business rivalry between SSLL and OSL.

Earlier, six persons, including Congress leader Bapi Sarkhel, were arrested by police in connection with the high profile murder.

Police in Jagatsinghpur district had issued a non-bailable warrant against Mishra, an influential businessman in Odisha, and Bal for their alleged involvement in the murder case.

On October 26, assailants hurled crude hand bombs at the vehicle of Seaways General Manager Mahendra Swain in Paradip while he was on his way to his office.

When Swain attempted to escape, they fired two shots at him killing him on the spot, said police.
