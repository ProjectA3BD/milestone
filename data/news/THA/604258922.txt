Thai police have arrested three suspected Muslim insurgents who had allegedly planned to launch bomb attacks in Bangkok.

The three suspects were earlier also detained by soldiers who invoked the emergency but the Narathiwat freed them on Tuesday, Deputy Police Commissioner Sriwarah Rangsipramkul said.

They were rearrested by police after a Criminal warrant was issued against them on last Friday, Sriwarah said, adding that they were charged with possessing illegal explosives and unlawful association, local media reported.

The insurgents were identified as Talmeshi Totalyong, 31, Abdullashi Luakraji, 19, and Mubahri Kana, 22. They are all residents of Muslim majority southern province Narathiwat.

Police said in October they had learned of a plot to launch car-bomb attacks in Bangkok by insurgents from the deep South.

Sriwarah added that at least one of the three had confessed to a plan to launch attacks in Bangkok.

Sriwarah said police had obtained evidence that the three suspects had met and planned the attack here.

Rights activists have criticised police for stepping up crackdowns on student activists in areas near Ramkhamhaeng University here after the alleged bomb plot was announced.
