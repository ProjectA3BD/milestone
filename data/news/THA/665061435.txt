BANGKOK, June 15 (Reuters) - Authorities in Thailand have arrested a 62-year-old suspect in connection with a bomb attack at a military-owned hospital in Bangkok last month that wounded 24 people, the defense minister said on Thursday.

The attack at the Phramongkutklao Hospital in central Bangkok came on the third anniversary of the army seizing power.

Defense Minister Prawit Wongsuwan told reporters a male suspect was being interrogated in connection with the bombing.

Prawit gave no indication of any suspected motive or affiliation of the suspect.

Police in charge of investigating the bombing have not commented on the arrest. (Reporting by Amy Sawitta Lefevre; Editing by Matthew Tostevin, Robert Birsel)
