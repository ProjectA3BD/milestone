Authorities in Thailand have suspended top human trafficking suspect Lt.General Manas Khongpaen from military service and seized four million Baht and other assets from him.

Manas, a former special adviser to the Thai army, was arrested on June 3 amid a crackdown on human traffickers in Thailand after discovery of 34 skeletons.

According to local daily, The Nation, the skeletons were believed to be of Myanmar's Rohingyas and Bangladeshi people-from mass graves in the southern region of Thailand.

Army commander General Udomdej Sitabutr said Lt.Gen. Khongpaen would be reinstated if declared not guilty.
