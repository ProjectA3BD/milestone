THE sister of Koh Tao murder victim Hannah Witheridge could face prosecution after she posted a scathing criticism of Thai authorities on Facebook earlier this week.

Coconuts Bangkok reports that Royal Thai Police Commissioner Chakthip Chaijinda said Thursday that police are investigating the Facebook post.

In the lengthy Facebook post published Sunday, Laura Witheridge slammed the “bungling” investigation into the murders of her sister and another British backpacker, David Miller.

In the post she claimed that she had received death threats and had been sent graphic images of the murder victim from Thai people.

In comments that she later deleted, Witheridge accused Thai court officils of making grossly insensitive remarks to her family, such as “why are you making such a fuss. She will be back in 30 days as something else, she may have better luck next time.”

In a statement issued Wednesday, Thailand’s court serviced expressed “deep concern” about Witheridge’s post, which has since been taken offline.

Chaijinda said Thursday he had assigned the International Affairs Division to translate Laura’s Facebook post to inspect whether it violates any laws.
