Ayutthaya: Sixty-four suspects were yesterday detained in a series of raids carried out by a combined force of close to 600 police, military and local administrative officials, said Aphinan Phueagphong, the deputy governor of the province.

Over 100 locations in all 16 districts of Ayutthaya were targeted in the raids aimed at suppressing illegal activities, particularly those involving narcotics, he said.

Authorities seized 888 methamphetamine tablets, 114 grammes of crystal methamphetamine, one gun and 45 bullets.

Twelve locations were raided in Bang Pa-in district, seven in tambon Chiang Rak Noi and five in tambon Ban Len, he said, adding that seven suspects were detained.

In Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya district, two drug suspects were apprehended in tambon Tha Wa Sukri, he said.

Ayutthaya has been used by major drug-trafficking gangs as a staging ground to transport illicit drugs to Bangkok and its surrounding provinces, he said.

Proof of this lies with the frequent drug crackdowns in which huge amounts of methamphetamines were seized in the province, he said.

Authorities are working together with community members to watch out for signs of drug smuggling.
