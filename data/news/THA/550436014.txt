An Australian man has been arrested over child pornography offences in Thailand, after allegedly posting content related to child molestation on social networking sites.

Stephen Le Cornu, 62, will appear before court following a joint operation by Thai and Australian police.

He was arrested on Tuesday at his Bangkok residence following a tip-off from Queensland Police that content had been posting by Le Cornu on overseas websites.

Le Cornu had allegedly used online chat rooms to post explicit stories about child sexual abuse as well as to post images of children, according to Queensland Police.

While Le Cornu confessed to posting child pornography online, authorities haven’t found any other evidence linked to abusing children.

Le Cornu is expected to be charged with offences under Thailand’s Computer Crimes Act, including possession of child pornography – a charge which carries a five year jail sentence.
