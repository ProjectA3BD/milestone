FOUR members of a Hells Angels bikie gang, including three Australians, have been arrested in Thailand accused of drug crimes, violence and posing a threat to society.

The arrests, which also included a Canadian, came on Wednesday in Pattaya, a major tourist resort with a reputation as a hub for foreign gangs, drug dealing and the sex industry.

Piyapong Ensarn of the Pattaya Tourist Police told Reuters two of the accused gang members would be deported and the two others would be charged with drug offences.

“Traces of cocaine were found on them,” he said.

Police said they were still looking for three Australians believed to be members of the gang. A British member of the gang had fled the country before he could be arrested, Piyapong said.

The gang made headlines in 2015 when one of its members was murdered by an Australian man, who was sentenced to death in February for the killing.
