Bangkok: Thai authorities have gathered evidence linking Monday's shrine bombing to another blast in what appeared to be a co-ordinated attack on the Thai capital.

Less than 30 minutes after a blast tore through tourists at the Erawan shrine, a man kicked a package into a canal at a pier near the Chao Phraya river several kilometres away.

CCTV footage has emerged showing the man wearing a blue T-shirt and fiddling with a mobile telephone.

A bomb packed with high explosives and ball bearings - similar to the one at the shrine - exploded in the canal the next afternoon. No one was injured in that blast, although the area is popular with tourists.
