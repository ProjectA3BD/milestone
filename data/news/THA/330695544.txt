Endeavour scholarships funded by the Australian Government have been awarded to 19 Thais for Australian study and research programs in 2015. Paul Robilliard, the Australian Ambassador to Thailand, recently hosted a reception in Bangkok to congratulate the merit-based award recipients.

Apart from furthering study and professional development, the Endeavour Scholarship program is designed to strengthen ties between participating countries. Four Australians will also be studying in Thailand as award winners, joining 160 students who will be undertaking study and work placements there under the New Colombo Plan.
