HE’S living it up, without having to pay the price. And he’s making us super-jealous right now.

Meet Andy McGinlay, a 33-year-old Scottish teacher who has managed to score a series of flight upgrades, for free.

So how did he do it? Did he sweet talk the flight attendants, or just have a combination of the perfect timing and pure luck?

No! Totally obsessed with flying Emirates over the past nine years, McGinlay decided to show just how deep his love for the airline was by getting a tattoo of their logo on his arm. And he never could have expected just what that grand gesture would land him in return.

McGinlay, who teaches English in Thailand and has travelled to 80 countries, swiftly soared to the top of the list of the airline’s top customers since getting inked.

He’s been treated to over $24,000 worth of upgrades and has enjoyed champagne and cognac in both business and first class.

The airline even surprised the loyal customer with a surprise 28th birthday party on board.

McGinlay told the UK’s Express: “As for my birthday party — I was flying Business Class from Dubai to Bangkok and the cabin crew saw it was my birthday from the date of birth on my passport.

“They invited me to their first-and-business-class bar and showered me with gifts, champagne and a chocolate cake. I felt like a rock star.”

The crew love posing with him for photos when they spot the tattoo.

“My mum calls me a walking billboard for Emirates and my friends think I’m nuts — they just don’t get my obsession,” he said. “Every time I’ve flown since I got the tattoo, the cabin crew are amazed — they always want to take photos with me in the galley showing off the tattoo.

“The list of perks I receive for being a frequent flyer is long. But obviously being upgraded regularly is the biggest perk of all. Flying First Class was by far the most amazing experience. I drank 10-year-old Dom Pérignon Champagne with Iranian caviar and tried a rare £464 bottle ($A880) of Hennessy cognac.”
