A grandmother beaten unconscious by a gang of youths in Thailand has started to give evidence in the trial of three men who were allegedly part of the group.

Rosemary Owen, 65, suffered serious head injuries in the attack, while her husband Lewis, 68, and son, also called Lewis, were also injured.

She had to spend weeks in hospital. Now, in court, she has spoken for the first time about what happened, reports the Daily Mail.

Speaking from a separate room in Hua-Hin provincial court as she couldn’t bear to face those accused, she said: ‘I still have nightmares. And the headaches. The headaches are there all the time.
