When Associated Press revealed last month that thousands of foreign workers were enslaved on fishing boats sending catches through Thailand to the world's fish markets, the country's military ruler pledged to prosecute those responsible amid an outcry in the United States from the seafood and retail industries.

"If they still continue to exploit their fellow human beings they should not be given any licences to operate businesses in Thailand and they must receive the punishment they deserve," said junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha.

Australian journalist Alan Morison and his colleague Chutima Sidasathian have been charged with defamation in Thailand.

Seafood processed in Thai factories is a multibillion-dollar industry and one of the country's top export earners.

However, as Thailand's military-appointed government laid out new laws targeting human trafficking, the Royal Thai Navy has pressed ahead with criminal proceedings that began a year ago against Australian journalist Alan Morison and his Thai colleague Chutima Sidasathian for reporting on trafficking of ethnic Rohingya boat people.
