The call at the Human Rights Council follows recent disappearances of five Hong Kong residents associated with a publisher of books banned in China and the temporary detention of a Swedish man accused of training unlicensed lawyers there. The Swedish national disappeared from his holiday home in Thailand and later made a tearful appearance on Chinese state TV to say he surrendered over a 12-year-old fatal drunk driving case.

The Western countries denounced the "unexplained recent disappearances and apparent coerced returns" of Chinese citizens and foreigners to China.

U.S. ambassador Keith Harper told the council state broadcasts of confessions before any judicial process violates international conventions and Chinese laws.
