Thailand has extradited a Russian citizen wanted by Kemerovo regional police in Siberia for banditry, kidnapping and extortion.

The Russian Interior Ministry said that Sergei Kovalenko, 25, was deported from Thailand on March 27.

Investigators say Kovalenko organized a criminal group, known as "Junior Sportsmen," in 2001 that was allegedly involved in stealing and extorting money from local businessmen in Kemerovo.

Kovalenko fled Russia after investigators arrested several members of his group in 2012.

In July, Thai authorities extradited another reputed Russian crime boss, Aleksandr Matusov.

Matusov, 52, was wanted in Russia for his alleged involvement in scores of killings and other criminal activities by an infamous criminal network in Moscow -- the Shchyolkovo Group.
