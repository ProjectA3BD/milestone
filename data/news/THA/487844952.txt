A street fight in broad daylight on a busy Bangkok street, with gunshots heard and at least one person injured.

The chasing, hacking and shooting happened on Monday in Lat Pla Khao area, and was captured on video by a taxi passenger.

She said at least 10 people were involved in the fight. They wore motorcycle helmets and their bikes had no licence plates.

"There were pedestrians and motorists around. I didn't record the entire incident because I was afraid," the passenger wrote on her Facebook page.

The video spread online, and net users were not impressed with the troublemakers and voiced their concerns about people being caught in the crossfire.

"These days when teens have different views, they kill each other without thinking about their parents," a Facebook user wrote.

Another wrote: "Thailand is a Buddhist country. Amitabha (If you're gone, who will stay with your mother)."
