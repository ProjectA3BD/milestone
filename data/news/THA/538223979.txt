Seized from them were 226kg of methamphetamine and 8kg of heroin kept in backpacks.

The train they were travelling in was enroute to Butterworth from Hualamphong, Bangkok.

Thai police have described the drug haul as one of the largest confiscated in recent times, which could fetch about RM400mil in Europe.

The Thai police officer also divulged that based on information obtained, there was a link between the Malaysian suspects and a major drug trafficker whose nationality he declined to divulge.

In an interview with Bernama previously, Police Col Puttidej Bunkrapue from the Thai Railway Police said investigations revealed the drug smuggling attempt by the 21 Malaysian suspects was masterminded by three men.

The 21 Malaysians are currently under remand at Bangkok's Central Correctional Institution for Drug Addicts. - Bernama
