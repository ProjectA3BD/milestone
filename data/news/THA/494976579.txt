Story highlights Thanakorn remains in custody after he was arrested last week in a raid on his home

Thailand's lese majeste laws are strictly enforced by the authorities

(CNN) A man in Thailand is facing up to 37 years in prison on charges that include mocking the King's dog.

Thanakorn Siripaiboon, 27, is accused of "liking" a Facebook page deemed insulting to King Bhumibol Adulyade and posting a sarcastic photo of the 88-year-old ruler's pet dog -- charges that contravene notoriously strict laws protecting the monarchy from insults or threats.

His lawyer, Anon Numpa, told CNN Wednesday that his client has been charged with violating Article 112 of the criminal code, known as the "lese majeste law," along with sedition and computer crimes.

"This is absurd, in every sense. They can't press charges against people who just click like on a post to express their agreement," said Numpa. "This is just a means for the military to stop us from digging up on their corruption."

Numpa was referring to the country's military rulers, who took control in 2014 after months of protests against the democratically elected government. Army chief General Prayuth Chan-ocha later declared himself Prime Minister.
