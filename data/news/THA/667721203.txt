Indonesia says terror charges laid in the United States against Hambali, the alleged mastermind of the 2002 Bali bombings, were aimed at providing the Guantanamo prisoner with "legal certainty".

Indonesian-born Encep Nurjaman - better known as Hambali - has been detained by the CIA and US since he was arrested in Thailand in 2003 but has never previously been charged with any offence. He is also known as Riduan Isamuddin.

However, a war court prosecutor has now filed the terror charges in the US.

The chargesheet, obtained by the Miami Herald, describes Hambali as having directed three simultaneous bombings in Bali on October 12, 2002 in an attack that killed 202 people, including 88 Australians. It remains the deadliest attack in Indonesia.
