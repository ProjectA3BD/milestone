A car crashed through a fence Friday night and struck worshippers at an outdoor shrine in Thailand.

Five people were injured, according to a Thai news agency. The crash was captured on surveillance video.

The Erawan Shrine was the scene of a terrorist attack a year ago, in which 20 people were killed and more than 100 injured in a bomb blast. The Friday night incident is believed to be accidental, but it is under investigation.

Images of the purported driver, a middle-aged woman, were posted on Twitter.

The incident came a week after a deadly terrorist attack in Nice, France, in which a man drove a truck through a large crowd, killing more than 80 people and injuring more than 200 people.
