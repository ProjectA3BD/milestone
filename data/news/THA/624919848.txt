A MAN has been sentenced to death in Thailand.

Antonio Bagnato has been found guilty for his role in the 2015 abduction and murder of Hells Angels gang member Wayne Schneider.

The judge, at the Pattaya criminal court, read the verdict on Tuesday to a packed courtroom.

Bagnato, who appeared before the court in prison clothes and leg irons, had pleaded not guilty to the November 2015 abduction and murder of Schneider at a luxury villa apartment at Pattaya, 150 kilometres from Bangkok. Thai police alleged Bagnato was the mastermind behind the abduction and killing of Schneider.

Schneider’s naked body was found in a shallow sandy grave in Sattahip province in Chonburi, 30 kilometres from the villa.

Thai police said conflicts over a multi-million dollar drug network extending from Europe to Asia lay behind the killing.

Reports said two security guards at the $5200-a-month villa complex had told Thai police Schneider’s abductors were wearing scarfs over their faces but they believed they were all foreigners.

But the guards told Thai police they were able to identify one of the men as Bagnato, who was frequently seen at the residence.

Thai police had three other suspects in the murder, including two Australians, who had fled Thailand soon after the murder.

Bagnatio was Schneider’s former body guard and business associate.
