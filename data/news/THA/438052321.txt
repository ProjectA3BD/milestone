BANGKOK - Thai authorities Tuesday said an arrest warrant has been issued for a high-ranking army officer over human trafficking, the first military figure in junta-ruled Thailand to be implicated in the grim trade in migrants from Myanmar and Bangladesh. The announcement comes a day after US President Barack Obama called on Myanmar to end discrimination against its minority Rohingya Muslim population, as the once pariah nation is widely viewed as catalysing their mass exodus.

More than 3,500 hungry and bedraggled Rohingya, as well as Bangladeshi migrants escaping poverty, have arrived on Thai, Malaysian and Indonesian soil in recent weeks after a trafficking crackdown by Thailand threw long-worn people-smuggling routes into disarray. Rights groups have long accused Thai officials of turning a blind eye to - or even complicity in - the trade of migrants through its southern provinces and into Malaysia, but until now no military personnel have been implicated.
