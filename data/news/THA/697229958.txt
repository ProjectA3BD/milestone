BANGKOK (AP) – Thai authorities arrested two Chinese citizens suspected of smuggling rhinoceros horns worth about $300,000 through Bangkok’s main airport.

The eight rhino horns weighing 6.2 kilogrammes were discovered Tuesday when airport security X-rayed the suspects’ baggage.

The Customs Department said yesterday that the two men were headed to Cambodia after a flight from Zambia that stopped in Addis Ababa and Bangkok.

Horns, blood, skin and urine from endangered rhinoceroses are in high demand across Asia for their use in traditional Chinese medicine.

Thai authorities said they seized 38 rhinoceros horns worth over $6 million in three cases over the past four years.

The suspects face charges of violating customs and wildlife protection laws.

Customs Department Director-General Kulit Sombatsiri said the seized rhino horns could fetch $300,000 in Thailand and even more abroad.
