Beijing, March 28 : A Chinese fugitive, who was on Interpol's list of 100 most-wanted and who spent 17 years in hiding, surrendered in Shanghai, the media reported on Monday.

Zhang Liping, 64, a former president of a running-shoe maker firm in Shanghai who allegedly falsified value-added tax invoices, surrendered to the local police on Sunday, the Shanghai Daily reported.

She fled to Thailand in August 1999 and later hid in Peru.

Zhang's name was placed on an Interpol Red Notice naming 100 people wanted for their involvement in serious corruption-related cases and who had fled overseas.

So far, 25 of the 100 have returned to China.
