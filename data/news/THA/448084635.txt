The FATHER of a young woman murdered on a Thai island wept in court as he was shown graphic images of her body lying on a beach.

Tony Witheridge was in court with his son for the third day of the trial of two men over the murder of Hannah, 23, from Norfolk, and David Miller, 24, from Jersey.

The two backpackers were killed on a beach on Koh Tao, an island in southern Thailand, last September. It is understood that they had met on the island whilst staying at the same hotel.

Post mortem examinations showed both had suffered severe head wounds and that Miss Witheridge had been raped.

Two Myanmar migrant workers, Zaw Lin and Win Zaw, have been accused of killing the pair.

They initially confessed to the murders but later retracted their statements, saying that they had been made whilst they were being tortured. Police deny any wrongdoing.

It has also been claimed that vital DNA evidence linking the two suspects to the death of Miss Witheridge no longer exists - so cannot be retested.

The families have travelled to the court in Koh Samui to be present for the trial.

Mr Miller's family said that they hope that travelling to the site of their son's death will help them in their grief.

"Over the coming weeks we hope to gain a better understanding as to how such a wonderful young man lost his life in such idyllic surroundings in such a horrible way."

Verdicts in the case are not expected until October.
