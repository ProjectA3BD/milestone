BANGKOK — A Spanish man was sentenced to death Friday morning at the Ratchada Criminal Court for the savage 2016 murder of a fellow Spaniard.

Artur Segarra Princep, 38, was sentenced to die for the January 2016 abduction, torture, murder and dismemberment of David Bernat, parts of whom were discovered floating in various locations along the Chao Phraya River.

Segarra has been jailed at the Bangkok Remand Prison since February 2016 after he was arrested in Sihanoukville province, Cambodia, and extradited back to Thailand.

Segarra made large ATM cash withdrawals before fleeing across the border after gaining access to Bernat’s account, which held about 37 million baht.

The court handed down a death sentence for the count of premeditated murder. He was also convicted of theft and ordered to return nearly 750,000 baht of the stolen funds to Bernat’s family.

Segarra maintains his innocence and his lawyer Worasit Piriyapiboon said they’ll appeal his conviction within 30 days.

Whether Segarra is ultimately executed or has his sentence reduced is up to the courts.

Capital punishment is enshrined in the law but its use effectively ended 14 years ago. The last execution took place in 2009, when two drug traffickers were killed by lethal injection. Before that, the previous execution was carried out in 2003.
