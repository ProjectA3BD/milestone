The choppers crashed in a province southwest of Bangkok, claiming 17 lives.

BANGKOK (AFP) - A Thai military officer was killed Friday when his F-16 fighter jet crashed during a training exercise in a central province, an official said.

The plane crashed at around 3 pm (0800 GMT) in Khok Samrong district of central Lopburi province.

"The pilot could not eject himself out of the plane in time," Lopburi governor Thanakom Chongchira told AFP by telephone.

The cause of the crash, which took place near an airforce training centre, is under investigation.

In November nine soldiers on board an army helicopter died when the chopper crashed in northern Thailand.

In July 2011 a series of helicopter crashes in the space of a week forced the Thai army to ground much of its fleet.
