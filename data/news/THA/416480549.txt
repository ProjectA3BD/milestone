An Australian businessman has been granted bail after being charged with murder on Thailand's holiday island of Phuket.

Mark Hamilton Pendlebury was charged with possessing a knife and murder with intent, accused of stabbing a nightclub security guard.

Reports said the 59-year-old allegedly stabbed the guard, who is a Thai national, after he was attacked while filming an altercation outside the club near Patong beach.

Pendlebury said he produced a knife in self defence.

The nightclub employee later died in hospital.

The West Australian man owns a sailing business in Phuket, and is a well-known businessman on the island.

He was granted bail although he must regularly appear before a Phuket court.
