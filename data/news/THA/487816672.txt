The two, identified as Bilal Mohammad and Mieraili Yusufu, were indicted on Tuesday on 10 charges connected to the 17 August blast at the Erawan shrine.

Thai officials have said the blast was revenge by a people-smuggling network against Thai authorities for breaking up their operation.

The two have been held at an army base since their arrests in August and September. They are being tried at a military court, where cases of national security have been handled since the army seized power in May 2014.
