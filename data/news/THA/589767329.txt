AN ARREST warrant has been issued for an Australian man called as a defence witness following the murder of an Australian bikie gang leader in Thailand.

Douglas Shubridge has been called by the lawyers of 26-year-old Antonio Bagnato, accused of murdering Hells Angels member, Wayne Rodney Schneider.

Schneider, 37, was abducted on November 30 from his rented villa in Pattaya, 150 kilometres southeast of Bangkok in an alleged dispute over money linked to drug trafficking.

Two days later his body was recovered by investigators from a shallow sandy grave in Chonburi province about 30 kilometres from his residence. Bagnato and 21-year-old American Tyler Joseph Fulton Sheen have been charged with Schneider’s killing, with the American arrested at a border crossing into Cambodia. Bagnato was arrested in a Phnom Penh hotel and extradited to Thailand. Last week a provincial appeal court rejected a bail application by Bagnato based on a fears he was a flight risk.

Along with that for Shubridge, arrest warrants have been issued for Bagnato’s wife, Siriphat Saimart, 25, and two other Thai nationals.

The Pattaya Criminal Court is due to hear witness interviews by the prosecution on November 17 and 18. The trial is expected to hear a total of 34 witnesses, with 18 people so far interviewed.

Police reports say Schneider, a senior member of the Hells Angels, was known to authorities as overseeing a multimillion-dollar drug trafficking network extending from Europe to Asia.

Bagnato was a former business associate of Schneider in Australia.
