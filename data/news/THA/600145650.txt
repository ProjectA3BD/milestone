MINOT, N.D. (AP) - A 64-year-old man accused of sexually abusing an 8-year-old Minot boy he was baby-sitting in 2014 has been extradited from Thailand to face felony sex crime and bail-jumping charges.

Mark Allen Rogers appeared in state district court this week. Judge Doug Mattson ordered him held without bond and advised him to apply for a public defender.

Rogers had been scheduled to stand trial last February, but he went missing and the court ordered his $50,000 bond forfeited.
