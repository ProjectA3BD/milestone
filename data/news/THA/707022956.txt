MENU

Authentic Thai food. The menu includes everything from Pad Thai to Orange Duck. There’s also a large selection of sushi.

ATMOSPHERE

This gem, tucked away in a nondescript strip shopping center, is infused with a charming ambiance. The colorful wall murals, captivating light fixtures and nice-size bar are eclipsed only by the warm welcome diners receive.

OUR FAVORITE FOOD/PRICE

Our server helped us navigate the menu, and her suggestion for the stir-fried duck with and red curry sauce ($22.95) was a winner in both taste and presentation. The bell peppers, basil, bamboo shoots and zucchini paired with the perfectly cooked duck tasted as good as it looked. The pho Kiew Teaw Kai ($11.95) with chicken, Chinese broccoli, bean sprouts, scallions and cilantro was a bowlful of yumminess. The fresh summer rolls ($6.95) — veggies wrapped up in rice paper — were light and tasty, the perfect way to start our dining experience. We also gave two thumbs up to one of the specialties, the Lobster Woonsen Pad Thai ($24.95), clear noodle Pad Thai with lobster and shrimp wrapped in an egg nest, so gorgeous it belongs on the cover of a food magazine.
