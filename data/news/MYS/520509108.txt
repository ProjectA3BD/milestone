Members of an ABC Four Corners crew have been detained in Malaysia while trying to question Prime Minister Najib Razak over a corruption scandal, the broadcaster has announced.

The ABC confirmed that journalist Linton Besser and camera operator Louie Eroglu were detained and released hours after attending a press conference in the city of Kuching.

Their passports were seized and they have been told not to leave the country, the ABC reported.

"They have not been charged with any offence," an ABC spokesperson said on Sunday.
