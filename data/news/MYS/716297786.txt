Bali: Australian accountant Isaac Emmanuel Roberts has been arrested after he was allegedly caught with drugs at Bali's international airport.

Customs authorities said the 35-year-old from Queensland was arrested after arriving from Bangkok with 19 grams of shabu, a slang term for the drug amphetamine, and ecstasy pills.

Customs officer Husni Syaiful said the Australian would face charges of importing more than five grams of drugs under article 113. Under Indonesian law the maximum punishment is the death penalty and the minimum five years' jail.

The man and two other foreigners from Malaysia and the US were paraded before the media on Tuesday wearing orange jumpsuits with balaclavas over their heads at Ngurah Rai customs office, near Bali's international airport. Their arrests were unrelated.
