The well-planned abduction by at least 15 masked men of a Protestant pastor and the disappearances of three other church-linked people in Malaysia have prompted fears of religious vigilantism in the Muslim-majority nation.

Security camera footage showed the daylight abduction of the 62 year-old pastor Raymond Koh in the leafy suburb of Kelana Jaya near the capital Kuala Lumpur on February 13.

A convoy of three black SUV's, two cars and two motor cycles blocked Mr Koh's car.

Several men ran to Mr Koh's car while one filmed the incident and another stopped traffic, witnesses said.
