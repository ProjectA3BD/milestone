JOHOR BARU: A staff member of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission has been detained by police on suspicion of wife abuse.

He was taken into custody in Batu Berendam, Malacca, last night.

Johor police chief Wan Ahmad Najmuddin Mohd said a remand order would be sought to detain the man, aged 37, for questioning.

The suspect, who worked at the Segamat MACC, was found to have been absent from work and was involved in a narcotics case in Muar last year, Wan Ahmad said in a statement late last night.

Two police reports had been made against the man, and investigation papers had been opened under the Penal Code and the Domestic Violence Act for deliberately causing hurt and for criminal intimidation.

The two police reports were made following a story which was shared online about a woman who had been a victim of domestic violence by her husband, a member of the MACC.
