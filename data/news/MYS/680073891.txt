A Thai man has been jailed for 18 years for posting six video clips deemed insulting to Thailand's monarchy on Facebook, as authoritarian regimes across south-east Asia crackdown on critics and freedom of speech.

Sixty-one-year-old Tara, whose last name has been withheld, cannot appeal the sentence because he was arrested in 2015 while Thailand was under martial law following a military coup the year before.

Thailand's military government has also charged veteran journalist Pravit Rojanaphruk and two political critics with sedition and computer crimes for Facebook commentary.

Mr Pravit has twice been detained for so-called "attitude adjustment" by the army and held "incommunicado" for days without charge for criticising the military's rule.
