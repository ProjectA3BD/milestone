Malaysia deports 32 Taiwanese to China, draws protest

BEIJING (AP) â€” Taiwanese officials have protested Malaysia's deportation of 32 of the self-ruled island's nationals to China to face wire fraud charges.

The deportation follows the sending of nearly four dozen Taiwanese from Kenya to China last month, a case that has raised concerns Beijing is exerting diplomatic pressure over the island it considers its own territory.

The Taiwanese Cabinet, in a statement late Saturday, says China pressured Malaysia to deport the Taiwanese wire fraud suspects to the mainland.

The island's foreign ministry lodged a protest with Malaysia for taking that action despite Taiwanese officials' efforts to negotiate and said the deportations would hurt relations.
