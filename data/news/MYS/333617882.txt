PETALING JAYA: Malaysia should seriously consider converting the National Audit Department into an independent commission to help boost its transparency and accountability rating.

In supporting such a suggestion, Transparency International (TI) Malaysia president Datuk Akhbar Satar said this would also help improve the quality of audit when the body was empowered to hire as many certified professional accountants.

“And the proposed commission should be given the power to bite in order to effectively prevent corruption and leakages,” he said, adding that a high-quality professional and independent audit team would help boost public confidence.

Public Accounts Committee chairman Datuk Nur Jazlan Mohamed said the Auditor-General had suggested this to him as it would overcome the biggest hurdle of attracting professionals with ACCA (Association of Chartered Certified Accountants) qualifications to work with the department.

Nur Jazlan, who was a panelist at a forum titled “Auditor General’s Report: Government Audit – Formality or Accountability” held in Penang on Friday, agreed that the department needed professional accountants to boost its competency.
