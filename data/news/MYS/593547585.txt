KANGAR, Oct 28 — A Thai rubber tapper was sentenced to three years’ jail by the High Court here today for smuggling in two Ugandan women into the country.

Judicial Commissioner Abu Bakar Katar handed down the sentence on Muhammad Romlee Arong, 40, who pleaded guilty to the charge.

He was ordered to serve the jail sentence from the date of arrest on march 24, 2016.

Muhammad Romlee, from Pattani, South Thailand, was charged with Wan Ahmad Wan Hassan, 42, with smuggling the two Ugandan women — Joy Gladys Filly and Jacintah Nakabuye, both 34, — at the Padang Besar Customs and Immigration Complex at 7.45pm on March 24 this year.

They were charged under Section 26G of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Act 2007, which provides an imprisonment for up to 10 years, and also liable to fine, or both, if found guilty.

However, Wan Ahmad, from Kuala Kedah, pleaded not guilty and claimed trial to the charge.

The court set Nov 24 and 25 to hear the case.

Earlier during mitigation, lawyer Rahmatullah Baharudeen, representing Muhammad Romlee, said his client was separated from his wife and was supporting two children.
