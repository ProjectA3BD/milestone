KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia strongly condemned the killing of 21 Egyptian citizens in Libya by a terrorist group affiliated with IS recently, said Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Anifah Aman.





In a statement issued today, he said the manner of the killings of the civilians were "utterly deplorable" and expressed the government's deep sympathy and condolences to the Egyptian government and families of the victims.





"May they have the strength and courage in this difficult time," said Anifah.





He stressed that Malaysia remained in solidarity with the Egyptian government as well as the international community in combatting terrorism and extremism.





It was reported that the 21 Egyptians were marched to a beach, forced to kneel and then beheaded on video, which was broadcast via a website that supports IS.





The victims were among thousands of unemployed Egyptians desperately seeking work in Libya, despite the risks. Egypt's foreign ministry said it was banning travel to Libya and had set up a crisis centre to bring home Egyptians.
