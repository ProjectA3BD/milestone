The 65 Chinese suspects and 32 Taiwanese suspects, deported together from Malaysia to the mainland on April 30, belonged to five criminal syndicates, said a public security ministry statement issued on Saturday after Chinese police and a delegation of judicial officials from Taiwan wrapped up a three-day meeting in Zhuhai city.

They were part of the 117 suspects detained in Malaysia for more than 100 telecom fraud cases, the People's Daily reported.

The other 20 Taiwanese were repatriated.
