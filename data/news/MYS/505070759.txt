KUALA LUMPUR: Thaipusam officially begins today but thousands of devotees have already arrived at the Batu Caves temple complex to fulfil their vows.

Dressed in plain yellow or orange, devotees carried either the paal kudam (milk pot) or the kavadi up the 272 steps to the cave’s temple.

Many were experienced hands, but there were first-timers, too, in the stream of devotees.

Among them was A. Tamilselvi, 18, who had vowed to carry a milk pot if she gained admission to a university of her choice last year.

“I have been given a conditional offer, but I’m confident I will get a full offer once my SPM results are out,” she said.

Tamilselvi, who will start her pre-university course in March, is hoping to further her studies in dentistry after that.

“My first experience was a little difficult because of the hot weather and the crowds, but I will get used to it,” she added.

Meanwhile, secondary school stu­­dents G. Devendran and M. Su­­resh Kumar, both 16, are planning to carry the kavadi next year after three consecutive years of carrying milk pots.

“We always do this together, and since we are sitting for the SPM examinations next year, we decided to carry a kavadi instead for that year,” said Devendran.

The two friends, however, admitted that carrying a kavadi was going to be even more challenging.

“Hot weather and the costs aside, we also need to consider the rituals involved and we will need more sup­­­port from family and friends to do this next year,” said Suresh Kumar.

Thaipusam is a Hindu festival in celebration of Lord Muruga.

On this day, devotees traditionally carry milk pots and kavadi to Lord Murugan temples as offerings and to fulfil their vows.
