PAS has become scapegoats in the tussle in Sarawak between DAP and PKR for state seats.

(Free Malaysia Today) – PAS Sarawak claims that hudud was not the only issue bedevilling the Pakatan Rakyat Sarawak (PR). “Hudud just covers up the failings of DAP Sarawak.”

“The serious issue is the disagreement between Parti Keadilan Rakyat Sarawak (PKR) and DAP Sarawak on the sharing of seats for the next state election,” said PAS Sarawak Information Chief Andri Zulkarnaen Hamden.

“PAS has become scapegoats in this tussle between DAP and PKR in the state. DAP Sarawak Chairman, Chong Chieng Jen, has been disingenuous in his arguments on hudud. It’s more important that he focus on the hudud motion in the Sarawak Assembly if he wants to flog the issue, not target PAS.”

DAP, he stressed, wanted more state seats than PKR and that was the root of the crisis in PR in the state. “There’s a lot of overlapping between DAP and PKR claims.”

He was commenting on Chong’s letter to Sarawak Chief Minister Adenan Satem proposing a bipartisan motion in the Sarawak Assembly to declare that “hudud would never be implemented in Sarawak”.

Andri did not know whether a free-for-all between DAP and PKR in the next state election would be a good idea. “The emphasis should be on the Opposition being united in order to defeat the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) and replace it as the state government or at least deny it a two-thirds majority in the worst case scenario.”

He conceded that PAS in Sarawak had failed to distance itself from the hudud issue in Kelantan as demanded by DAP. “Still, we have to keep in mind that non-Muslims form the overwhelming majority, 75 per cent, in Sarawak,” he pointed out. “So, the issue of hudud in Sarawak does not arise.”
