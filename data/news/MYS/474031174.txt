Three Chinese female tourists were killed on Wednesday in a serious traffic accident near Yong Peng in Malaysia's state of Johor, while two Chinese tourists were seriously injured and 15 others suffered slight injuries, according to the Chinese Embassy in Malaysia.

The Chinese Embassy in Malaysia launched an emergency mechanism after the accident, and was coordinating with the local government to deal with the aftermath of the accident.

An official of the Chinese embassy said that all the 20 victims came from a Chinese tourist group, and the three death victims were from China's Jiangsu Province, while the two tourists with serious injuries came from provinces of Jiangsu and Hubei.

Bernama, Malaysia's state news agency, quoted the local police chief as saying that the accident occurred when a lorry skidded into the opposite lane following a tire puncture, and collided with two buses.
