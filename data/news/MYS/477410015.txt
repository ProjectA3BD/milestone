KUALA LUMPUR: Police have arrested a man who threatened a security guard with two live bullets.

Speaking at a press conference, Wangsa Maju police chief Supt Muhamad Roy Suhaimi Sarif said in the 5.45am incident on Oct 16, the 50-year-old security guard at a condominium in Jalan Pahang here, had advised the suspect, a resident at the same condo, not to park indiscriminately.

"But the suspect told the guard 'don't mess with me' and handed two live bullets to him as a warning," Roy said.

Following a complaint by the guard, the CID team from Wangsa Maju raided the 46-year-old suspect's unit and found a pistol and 12 live ammunition.

"Two other men, aged 30 and 47, were nabbed together with the suspect, " he added.

Preliminary investigations found that the other two suspects had past records for drugs and assault cases.

They have been remanded under Section 8 (Firearms Increased Penalties) of the Penal Code until Oct 23 to facilitate investigations.

Meanwhile, in a separate case, police have arrested a 30-year old local man and are on the hunt for his accomplice, who was believed to have been extorting money from a site manager.

"The victim, 50, who is a site manager for an upcoming luxury apartment at Taman U-Thant, said the extortion had been going on since April this year and the final one was the last straw," Roy added.

Following the police report lodged by the victim, police nabbed the suspect at Batu 9 in Cheras on the same day.

"The suspect had apparently been threatening the victim that if he failed to pay up, they will burn the excavator machine at the site," he said.
