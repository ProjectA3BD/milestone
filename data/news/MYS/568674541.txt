KUALA LUMPUR: A doctor claimed trial in a Sessions Court here to a charge of manslaughter in the death of the son-in-law of Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi.

Dr Ting Teck Chin (pix), 36, pleaded not guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under Section 304(b) of the Penal Code for the death of Datuk Syed Alman Syed Alwi on June 1.

The alleged offence took place between 6pm and 7pm at a dental centre in Jalan Telawi, Bangsar.

Dr Ting, who is an obstetrician/gynaecologist, faces a 10-year-jail term, a fine or both.

Sessions judge Zainal L Saleh set bail at RM20,000 with one surety. The case will be mentioned again on Oct 17.

It was reported that Syed Alman fell unconscious while undergoing surgery at the centre.

He was rushed to University Malaya Medical Centre where he was pronounced dead.

In Facebook posting in June, the dental centre said Syed Alman's surgery was performed while he was sedated.

"It was a procedure that involved minor oral surgery under sedation with the presence of a trained medical practitioner," said the dental centre in a statement.

It said it made the statement to “dispel any public speculations or misconception as to the incident”.
