KUALA LUMPUR: The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) has not ruled out that more individuals will be charged in connection with the misappropriation of a book publishing fund involving RM15 million.

MACC Investigations Director Azam Baki said the details of the parties involved had been handed over to the deputy public prosecutor for further action.

“I do not dismiss the possibility that more people will be charged in the near future, but I cannot reveal any detail on who are involved,” he told Bernama when contacted last night.

On Aug 25, eight people, including Bank Rakyat managing director Mustafha Abd Razak, were detained to facilitate investigations into the case.

The bank’s chairman, Abdul Aziz Zainal, was detained four days later.

Mustafha and Abdul Aziz were charged in the Sessions Court here yesterday with criminal breach of trust and abetment, respectively, involving RM14,991,283.20.

Both pleaded not guilty before judge Madihah Harullah.
