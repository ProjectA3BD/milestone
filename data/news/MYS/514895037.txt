Phnom Penh: Australia warned travellers that terrorists may be planning attacks in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur but never told Malaysian police what prompted the warning.

"I strongly call upon Australia, if they have something, share with us," Malaysia's police chief Khalid Abu Bakar told reporters in Kuala Lumpur.

"In this case, I do not know on what basis the advisory was issued," he said.

Australia's travel advisory website smartraveller.gov.au warned of a possible attack in Kuala Lumpur last Sunday, indicating Australian agencies had received specific information about a potential terrorist plot.
