A central suspect in the deadly bombing of a Bangkok shrine last month has fled to Turkey, the Thai police said Monday. A senior Turkish official denied that, though, saying there was no record the suspect had entered the country. The Thai police had previously said the man, carrying a Chinese passport in the name of Abudureheman Abudusataer, might have directed the bombing of the Erawan Shrine, which killed 20 people. Investigations revealed that he left Thailand for Bangladesh on Aug. 16, the day before the bombing, and a Thai police spokesman, Prawut Thavornsiri, said Monday that he had then taken a circuitous route to Istanbul. This bolstered a theory of involvement by ethnic Uighurs from western China who have close ties to Turkey. Two other major suspects are in custody, charged with possession of illegal explosives. Also on Monday, Malaysiaâ€™s police chief announced that a Pakistani and two Malaysians had been detained in the bombing, but did not provide details.
