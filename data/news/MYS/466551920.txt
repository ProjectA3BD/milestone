KUALA LUMPUR: A Pakistani man and two Malaysians were detained here last week to assist in a probe on the bombing of a Hindu shrine in central Bangkok that killed 20 people including five Malaysians on Aug 17.

Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar (pix) said the three individuals, including a Malaysian woman, are being held under the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012, (Sosma) and assisting police in its probe on the case.

"We are working closely with our Thai counterparts. The trio were held following a tip-off from Thai police. We are yet to ascertain if they are involved in the bombing but we believe they can assist us." he told a press conference after attending the International Meeting on Global Piracy, Armed Robbery and Maritime Security here today.

Khalid said the detained foreigner is employed in Malaysia.

Asked if the suspects have been handed over to Thai police, he said: "Not at the moment. They are under the custody of Malaysian police."

Khalid added there was no evidence the main suspect responsible for the bombing is in Malaysia.

He declined to comment further when asked where the trio were held.

It was reported that the Malaysians were held at the Thai-Kelantan border for aiding the Pakistani to sneak into Malaysia last week.
