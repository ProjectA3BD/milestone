Malaysia court postpones trial of Australian woman accused of drug trafficking

Posted

The trial of an Australian woman charged with drug trafficking in Malaysia has been pushed back by a month due to delays completing a chemist report on the alleged contraband.

Maria Elvira Pinto Exposto, a 52-year-old mother of four, was arrested on December 7 at Kuala Lumpur airport with 1.5 kilograms of crystal methamphetamine, also known as ice.

A chemist report on the substance was to be submitted to the court on Friday, but was not yet ready, defence lawyer Tania Scivetti said.

A new date has been set for March 26.

Malaysia has a mandatory death penalty by hanging for anyone found guilty of carrying more than 50 grams of a drug.

If illegal drugs are confirmed, the case is expected to be elevated to a higher court that can handle death penalty cases.

Ms Scivetti said the case could stretch to at least the end of the year.

"She is in good spirits. She wants to get out of prison quickly," she said.

Defence lawyers say Exposto was duped into carrying a bag - which she believed contained only clothing - by a stranger who asked her to take it to Melbourne.

She had travelled to Shanghai after falling for an online romance scam by a person claiming to be a US serviceman, according to lawyers.

Customs officers discovered the drugs stitched into the compartment of a backpack.

The defence is yet to enter a plea until the case reaches a higher court.

Two Australians were hanged in 1986 for heroin trafficking - the first Westerners to be executed in Malaysia.

Few people have been executed in Malaysia in recent years.
