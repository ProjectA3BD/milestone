SINGAPORE, Sept 8 — The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore said today (Sept 8) that it has suspended the import of horses from Malaysia since September 6 in a bid to avoid the spread of the equine influenza (EI) that broke out in the neighbouring country.

Singapore is free from EI, a highly contagious viral disease that can have devastating effects on the horse industry, according to AVA.

AVA advises members of the public who may have come into contact with horses in Malaysia, such as when taking part in horse riding activities or during farm stays, to avoid visiting horse establishments in Singapore.

“AVA will work closely with Malaysia’s Department of Veterinary Services to allow the movement of horses between Singapore and Malaysia to resume once the outbreak in Malaysia is resolved,” AVA said in a statement.

Clinical signs of equine influenza include fever, nasal discharge, swollen mandibular lymph nodes, dry cough, poor appetite and lethargy. The disease is unlikely to cause death and infected horses recover in 3 weeks to 6 months, depending on the severity of infection. EI does not infect or cause disease in humans. ― Today
