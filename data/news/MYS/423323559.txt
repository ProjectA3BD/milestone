Malaysia has passed a controversial anti-terrorism bill, which the government says is needed to tackle the threat from Islamic extremists, reports the BBC.

The bill reintroduces indefinite detention without trial - something the prime minister had repealed in 2012.

Human Rights Watch called the move "a giant step backwards for human rights". It was passed hours after the police announced the detention of 17 suspected militants believed to be planning attacks in the capital, Kuala Lumpur.

Home Minister Zahid Hamidi said those arrested, the youngest just 14, were planning to attack police stations and army bases to gather weapons. Two of the suspects had just returned from Syria, police said.

Debate on the anti-terrorism bill went late into Monday night in parliament. Under the legislation, suspects can be held without trial for up to two years, with multiple extensions allowed after that.

Decisions on their detention will be made by a terrorism board, rather than the judiciary. It also allows the authorities to revoke travel documents, Malaysian or foreign, of people travelling to or from Malaysia to support or engage in terrorism.

The bill still needs approval from the Senate, but the chamber is dominated by the ruling coalition and it is expected to pass.
