MANILA, Philippines - To continue the joyful spirit of the holidays, Tourism Malaysia recently held a special thanksgiving party for its industry partners, friends and the media.

Tourism Malaysia is proud to have been actively promoting the beauty of its different cities and states from Kuala Lumpur to Sabah, which showcase a wonderful assortment of attractions reflective of the country’s culture and traditions.

As one of the Philippines’ closest neighbors, Malaysia has become a favorite tourism destination whether for families, groups of friends or even solo travelers who seek fun adventures.

Malaysia has modern attractions like the KL Tower, Legoland Malaysia theme park, Genting Highlands and the world-famous Petronas Towers. The country is also teeming with natural wonders that complement its rich culture born from many different ethnicities that have made Malaysia their home.

Malaysia’s food has also been appreciated by tourists who all enjoy the delicious sampling of flavors that bear Malay, Indian and Chinese influences. It’s also one of the reasons a lot of visitors enjoy going to Malaysia, aside from the great shopping attractions and the colorful cultural influences.

Tourism Malaysia is happy to have been warmly welcomed by the Philippine community as it has finally set up an office in BGC. It has been working hard with local travel agencies and tourism-related businesses from both the Philippines and Malaysia to continue on strengthening the cultural and economic ties of the two countries, especially with the upcoming ASEAN integration.

As it launches an exciting new theme for its 2015 campaign, Tourism Malaysia is happy to have met its 2014 targets with the help of the press and its industry partners. It looks forward to surpassing its success in 2014 through better relations and, of course, a lot of hard work.
