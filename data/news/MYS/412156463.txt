KUALA LUMPUR: An unemployed man was sentenced to 12 months' jail by the Sessions Court, here, for breaking into the house of a real estate developer last year.

Judge Zanol Rashid Hussain passed the sentence on Adiraj Le Zyon Gerege @ Abdul Hamid, 32, from Sandakan, Sabah, after he pleaded guilty to the charge.

Zanol Rashid also sentenced Adiraj to six months of jail for failing to show his identity card to a policeman, with both sentences to run concurrently from the date of his arrest, Oct 14, 2014.

According to the charge, Adiraj had broken into the house of developer Roger Lim Swee Kiat, 36, and taken three laptops, an iPad, a hard disk, and a money box containing RM346.

He was accused of committing the offence in Jalan Sri Petaling, here, at 5.15am on Oct 14, 2014. The offence under Section 457 of the Penal Code carries a jail sentence of up to 14 years and a fine.

According to the case's facts, the victim heard noise like someone was breaking into the house through the kitchen door and phoned the police.

When the police arrived, the intruder was still in the house and they arrested him.

DPP Nabilah Ahmad Poad asked for a deterrent sentence while counsel Ahmad Ridza Mohd Noh, representing the accused, asked for a light sentence as he regretted his action and had to support his family. â€“ Bernama
