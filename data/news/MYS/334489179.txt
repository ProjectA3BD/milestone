THE Association of Accredited Advertising Agents Malaysia (4As) has launched a commemorative book on the Effie Awards.

Nicky Lim, Effie Awards 2013 organising chairman, notes that the book is a comprehensive record of Effie Award winners from 2008 – 2013.

The book will prove to be useful tool in the pursuit of excellence, he adds.

“We are now receiving better quality entries, better story capabilities, and better results evidenced from the continuous development and training programmes initiated and implemented by the advertising industry,” says Lim.

He adds that opportunities for marketing continue to flourish with the evolving technological and digital advances, the diverse media landscape, and the upturn of consumer involvement.

The 106-page hardcover book serves as a celebration of the great work executed by advertising agencies in the five years since the Effie Awards was introduced in Malaysia.

The book lists all the main category winners from the past years.

It also provides a distilled outline of the campaign rationale for each of the lead category award winners.

The book also comes with a CD featuring the winning work from brands in the Gold, Silver, Bronze, and Finalist categories from 2013.

In the foreword to the Effie Awards: Winners Showcase 2008 – 2013 book, 4As president datuk Johnny Mun notes that the rules and regulations for submitting an entry for the Effie Awards are painfully stringent – and for a good reason.

“Measuring marketing effectiveness is a tedious task,” believes Mun. “It requires a detailed account of the process in creating a campaign.”

Those not from the advertising industry or who missed the Effie Awards can now have a chance to view the outstanding work of some of Malaysia’s innovative brands.

The Effie Awards is the only global award that honours achievement in meeting and exceeding marketing communications objectives, with a focus on effective campaigns.
