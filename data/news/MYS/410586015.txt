KUALA LUMPUR: Police arrested Parti Sosialis Malaysia (PSM) secretary-general S. Arutchelvan under the Sedition Act, at about 7pm today.

City Criminal Investigation Department chief Assistant Commissioner Zainuddin Ahmad confirmed the arrest.

Arutchelvan was brought to Dang Wangi police station for investigation.

In a Facebook posting, PSM said police from the Dang Wangi police station had detained him at his home and seized his computer, modem and mobile phone.

The arrest was made following Inspector General of Police Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar that Arutchelvan would be detained under the Sedition Act over criticism made on Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahimâ€™s sodomy conviction.
