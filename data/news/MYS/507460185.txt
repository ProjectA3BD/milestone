KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 1 — A man was hacked to death by a group of men using machetes and swords near a restaurant in Puchong, near here, last Saturday.

Serdang police chief ACP Razimi Ahmad said the incident occurred at 8pm last Saturday when the victim, R. Nagaiyan, 30, was walking in the area with his brother and friend.

“The victim was severely injured and he succumbed to the injuries at 10.33pm the same day while receiving treatment at the Universiti Malaya Medical Centre,” he told Bernama when contacted here.

Razimi said six suspects aged between 25 and 40 had been arrested and remanded to facilitate further investigation into the case.

“Police are still on the hunt for four other suspects,” he said, adding that the incident might have been caused by a misunderstanding over parking lot rental. — Bernama
