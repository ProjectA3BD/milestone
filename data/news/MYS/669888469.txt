PADANG RENGAS, July 3 — The Aidilfitri celebration in this country is one way foreign tourists get to view Malaysian culture, said Tourism and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Nazri Abdul Aziz.

At the same time, he said, it also fostered harmonious relations between the diverse races in the country, thus promoting prosperity and happiness.

“We are fortunate that the country is peaceful, and we are grateful to the government, police and Malaysian Armed Forces for making sure that it remains calm and prosperous.

“As we enjoy ourselves, we should not forget our friends in other countries who cannot enjoy Aidilfitri due to wars,” he said in his speech at the Padang Rengas Parliamentary Constituency Hari Raya Aidilfitri celebrations held here last night.

The event was attended by about 3,000 people who were feted to various types of food.

Mohamed Nazri, who is also Padang Rengas Member of Parliament, said Perak had its special features and natural attractions.

He said the state was expected to attract 10 million domestic tourists during the Visit Perak Year this year.

“I am confident and believe that this target can be realised, with the new attractions like the Movie Animation Park Studios (MAPS), as well as the mesmerising natural attractions including Pulau Pangkor, the Royal Belum Park, Gua Tempurung and Lenggong, “ he said. — Bernama
