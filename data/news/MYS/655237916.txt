Kuala Lumpur: Malaysia said it had deported three Turkish men to Ankara over suspected links to a group blamed by Turkey for a failed coup last year.

Human rights groups condemned the deportations conducted on Friday and the United Nations said Malaysia's action raised serious concern for the safety of Turkish nationals in the region.

Authorities detained school principal Turgay Karaman, 43, businessman Ihsan Aslan, 39, and academic Ismet Ozcelik, 58, last week, saying they posed a threat to national security.

Rights groups said they were concerned the action had been taken against the men because of pressure from Turkey.
