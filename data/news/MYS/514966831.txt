KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 24 — The Sessions Court here today set March 28 for submission by both parties in the case of controversial blogger Alvin Tan and his girlfriend who were charged with insulting the Muslims during Ramadan three years ago.

Judge Abdul Rashid Daud fixed the date after deputy public prosecutor Nurfaida Mohd Rashidee, who prosecuted, informed the court that the prosecution was closing its case.

Alvin Tan or Tan Jye Yee, and Vivian Lee or Lee May Ling are charged with uploading their picture with a caption, “Selamat Berbuka Puasa (with Bak Kut Teh...fragrant, delicious and appetising)” which also contained the halal logo in their Facebook.

They are charged under Section 4(1)(c) of the Sedition Act and were alleged to have committed the offence at 9 am on July 12, 2013.

They are also facing a charge under sub-section 5(1) of the Film Censorship Act 2002 for allegedly posting an obscene photograph on the same Facebook page between 9 pm on July 6, 2013 and 2 am on July 7, 2013.

The prosecution went ahead with the trial against Lee, despite Tan’s absence. Tan is believed to have fled to the United States to avoid attending the trial proceedings.

Lee was represented by lawyer Chong Joo Tian. — Bernama
