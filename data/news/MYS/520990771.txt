AN ABC journalist and cameraman have been told they will not be charged over an incident with Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, only hours after they were told to face court.

Four Corners reporter Linton Besser and cameraman Louie Eroglu had questioned Mr Najib during a public event in Kuching over a corruption scandal, and police had claimed they had crossed a security cordon - an allegation they deny.

Last night, Besser and Eroglu were told they would likely be charged with obstructing a public servant in the discharge of their duties.

If they were found guilty of the charge they could have faced two years in prison.

But three hours after the pair were given the order to appear in court on Tuesday morning, their lawyer was called by police and told no charges would be filed and they may be able to leave the country this morning after some paperwork.
