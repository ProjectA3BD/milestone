KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 16 — Umno lawmaker Tan Sri Shahrir Samad called out the DAP today for opposing the toll abolition of the Eastern Dispersal Link (EDL) while campaigning to end toll collection elsewhere.

The Johor Bahru MP since 1978 noted that at least two of the federal Opposition party’s lawmakers had criticised the Barisan Nasional (BN) government’s announcement to abolish the EDL and three other tolls nationwide, after saying in January said toll abolition, specifically on the North-South Expressway and the Penang Bridge, will be in Pakatan Harapan’s manifesto for the upcoming 14th general elections.

“DAP’s MPs are trained to see the unseen, to forget whatever they have said and ignore all inconvenient truths.

“They are the classical oppositionists and will fail at governing,” said Shahrir in a statement.

He named Kulai MP Teo Nie Ching and Petaling Jaya Utara MP Tony Pua as those critical of the government’s move to abolish the three tolls.

Teo had yesterday labelled the toll abolition a “bailout” while Pua alluded that concessionaires will have to be compensated by taxpayers.

“So instead of applauding toll abolition because it will benefit those who use the roads, they will claim it is the concessionaire which benefits from abolishing the toll,” Shahrir added.

The BN veteran questioned DAP’s logic in wanting to protect taxpayers by opposing the toll abolition that would save motorists money.

“Maybe they think that a concession can just be terminated unilaterally and as they had proposed during the 13th General Elections and the Employees Provident Fund can just take over toll roads without the depositors being negatively impacted,” Shahrir said.
