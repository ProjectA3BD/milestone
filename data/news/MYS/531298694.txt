Taiwan Repatriates 20 Fraud Suspects from Malaysia despite Beijing Pressure



TAIPEI  Twenty Taiwanese nationals suspected by the Chinese government of telecommunications fraud in Malaysia were repatriated Friday night and Saturday morning to Taiwan, despite pressure from Beijing to send them to China, according to Taiwans Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB).



The 20 Taiwanese, part of a group of 52 arrested in Malaysia in late March for alleged telecommunications fraud, arrived at Taoyuan International Airport after negotiations between the island nation and Malaysian authorities.



The CIB said in a press release that they had decided to release the suspects after discussing the matter with the city government of Taichung, where most of the suspects reside, because there was a lack of solid evidence of their involvement in criminal activities.



The CIB said it would ask the police and judicial authorities in China to provide information on the alleged illegal activities of Taiwanese suspects to conduct further research and initiate legal proceedings where appropriate.



The repatriation of these suspects comes less than a week after Kenya sent 45 Taiwanese suspects to China, hooded and shackled, to be tried for telecommunications fraud.



Taiwan described the deportation of the 45 Taiwanese to China as an extrajudicial kidnapping and a violation of basic fundamental rights as they were forced at gunpoint to get on a Chinese plane.



China justified the deportation saying that the suspects are Chinese and according to earlier cases, Taiwan does not sufficiently punish criminals.



Taiwanese diplomats expect the remaining 32 Taiwanese suspects detained in Malaysia to also be deported to Taiwan and not to China.
