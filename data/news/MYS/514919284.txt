KUALA LUMPUR: The 23-year-old youth who was charged with stealing a mobile phone at Low Yat Plaza last year, faced another charge today, of voluntarily causing hurt to a mechanic, four days ago.

Laundry workers Shahrul Anuar Abdul Aziz and Muhammad Shameer Zaidi, 19, claimed trial when the charge was read to them before magistrate Mohd Rehan Mohd Aris.

They allegedly slashed Hafizuddin Hamzah, 27, on the head with a machete, with two other individuals still at large in front of a workshop, Mizan Racing Tuned in Jalan Jelatek here at 3.30am on February 20.

Deputy public prosecutor Muhammad Farith Muhammad Faizal proposed a RM10,000 bail with one surety for each of the accused.

However, the judge did not grant bail as the duo were not present in court today.

On July 14 last year, Shahrul Anuar claimed trial to stealing a mobile phone worth RM800 at Techasia Boutique, Low Yat Plaza, Bukit Bintang at 4.47pm on July 11, the same year.

On February 12 this year, he was fined RM2,000 by the magistrate’s court after pleading guilty to the misuse of drugs on July 12, 2015.
