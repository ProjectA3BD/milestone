TAWAU, July 14 — The Tawau Fire and Rescue Department confirmed that 64 stalls at Pasar Gantung in Jalan Stephen Tan, here, were destroyed by fire, early today.

Its operations officer, Faisal Ahmad in a statement said the fire also spread to 12 shop lots in an adjoining two-storey building, with five of them razed to the ground.

“Our firemen had difficulty to put out the fire due to the low water pressure at the location. Thus, the Water Department was contacted and it assisted us in dousing the blaze by sending its lorry tankers,” he said.

Faisal said they also received help from the Kunak fire station and other agencies including the police, Civil Defence Force, Sabah Electricity Sdn Bhd, RELA and Tawau Municpal Council in preventing the fire from spreading to other premises.

No casualties were reported in the fire which reportedly started at 4.41 and was completely doused by 7.20am.

Today’s fire is the third in two weeks after the blaze in Kampung Hidayat, Batu 4 on July 1 and in Jalan Tawau Lama, Batu 2 on July 10. — Bernama
