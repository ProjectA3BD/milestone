Aimed at the betterment of the lives of shelter dogs, PAWS UP! Malaysia hosted its second photography fundraiser for the shelter dog series entitled Woof of Paws Street and raised a total of RM15,000 in private donations and auction. The photographs, which went to the highest bidder, ranged from RM188 to a whopping RM5000.

Shot by photographer Kim Mun, the series showcased 30 man’s best friends in their most natural manner in monochrome and without props or other embellishments. Even without the additions, the lovable spirit of the dogs shone through and took center stage.

The RM15,000, which will be contributed to the 400 to 500 animals housed at PAWS Animal Shelter Malaysia, will go a long way as 4.050kg of dog food or 1.935kg of cat food can be obtained to feed to feed the dogs for 81 days, or the cats for 193 days. Independent community PAWS UP! additionally hopes to expand with bigger plans, and to help out more shelters.

PAWS UP! champions The Mutual Rescue concept as they believe rescued animals are more than just pets; they teach honesty, loyalty, unconditional love and hold an imperative role in society as lifelong companions and therapists to the less fortunate. 2017 sees PAWS UP! seek a donated piece of land to run a self-sufficient mutual rescue animal shelter.

Woof of Paws Street by PAWS UP! was made possible thanks to the following sponsors – Ruyi & Lyn, Colorific Printers, Extreme Limousines, Tom’s Stickers, Stella Artois, Honey-Bae Design, GOBEAR Malaysia, Parking Elite, BSC, and Adrian Jalaludin.
