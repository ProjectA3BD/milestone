KUALA LUMPUR: A 31-year-old man was sentenced to four years' jail by the High Court here for possessing terrorist-related materials.

The suspect, Muhammad Hanif Ismail, pleaded guilty to two counts and was sentenced to two years' jail for each charge.

Judicial Commissioner Datuk Ab Karim Ab Rahman ordered the terms to run concurrently.

Muhammad Hanif committed the offences in Kuala Lumpur on March 24, and also in Temerloh, Pahang on March 26.

In meting out the punishment, the judge said it reflected the seriousness of the offences.

"Even though the offences only started with possession of terrorism-related material, they can lead to real terrorism, which doesn't need borders to happen," stressed Ab Karim.

Muhammad Hanif, who is unmarried, was charged under Section 130JB(10(a) of the Penal Code, which carries a jail term of up to seven years or a fine, and liable to forfeiture of relevant items, upon conviction.

According to the facts of the case, Muhammad Hanif was apprehended by police at Wangsa Walk Mall and led to a house in Taman Setapak.

Police also took him to his family's house in Temerloh, Pahang, where several black and white stickers – suspected to be of the Islamic State (IS) logo – and a pen drive were seized.

His parents, Ismail Bakar and Asiah Mutafa, confirmed that the material belonged to him.

Earlier in mitigation, counsel Ahmad Nizam Hamid said Muhammad Hanif had pleaded guilty and was remorseful of his actions, which arose from curiosity.

Deputy public prosecutor Mohamad Mustaffa P. Kunyalam urged the court to impose an appropriate sentence "as a lesson to the accused, considering the seriousness of the offence and rampancy of terrorist activities". – Bernama
