Vikram's I(Ai) is not only doing well in India but is also faring well at the international markets. At the Golden Screen Cinemas, simply known as GSC in Malaysia, all tickets were sold out for an entire day on 17th of January. A Chinese who watched the movie in Malaysia told the reporters that she had never seen an Indian movie with Chinese martial arts performed so perfectly.

Chan Wee, a Malaysian had written,"After a long time i am watching a Tamil film in the theatre because my Indian friends forced me to watch it. But I didn't want to waste my money for a movie where I don't understand the language. But, I thank my friends for bringing me to a wonderful film. It's called I, yes, only one letter, I, but it has so much of meaning behind it. The movie was seriously amazing, awesome performance by all the actors especially the main actor Vikram. Its really worth the time and money. I suggest all non-indians to watch the movie. Trust me you'll be amazed by the scenes."

Vivian T Yee, another Malaysian wrote,"I think the whole movie is beautifully shot. I felt so connected to Vikram that I almost shed tears for some scenes. His acting is real good, no doubt. Other than the part where a few characters make fun of disfigured people which contradicts with the theme of the movie, I truly enjoyed it. I loved how the director paid attention to the minute details. The creativity is outstanding. The scenaries, places and oh god the ads and fighting scenes never seemed so fun. To more amazing movies like this. Cheers and thank you for the subtitles."

While Eliza Alex said it's a great movie and an awesome performance by Vikram, Kelvin said no other Indian movie is as amazing as I. Praising Vikram's performance, he also said that he has become a fan of Vikram. "Great film, go watch it guys", wrote Kelvin before signing off.
