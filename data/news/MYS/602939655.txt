KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 27 — The Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) has filed an appeal against the sentence handed down by the Shah Alam Magistrate’s Court on a married couple who roughed up a female Shah Alam City Council (MBSA) enforcement personnel.

Attorney-General Tan Sri Mohamed Apandi Ali, in a statement today, said the appeal was filed as the AGC felt that the 14-day jail and RM3,000 fine meted on Lor Ka Hoo and Tan Sit Fun was manifestly inadequate.

He said the appeal was filed on the same day after the sentence was meted out on the couple, which was last Friday.

“Although both the accused pleaded guilty, a commensurate sentence should be imposed as a lesson to them, as well as others to not commit the same mistake,” he added.

Mohamed Apandi said AGC viewed seriously act of criminal force to intimidate civil servants from discharging their duties.

He said Section 353 of the Penal Code provided an imprisonment of up to two years, or fine, or both, those found guilty of using criminal force to deter public servants from discharging their duties.

Lor, 35, and Tan, 30, had pleaded guilty to using criminal force to prevent Nurul Ain Isa, 23, from discharging her duty at Bukit Rahman Putra, Sungai Buloh, last Thursday. — Bernama
