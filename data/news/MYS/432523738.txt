The UN says that 25,000 people have fled Myanmar and Bangladesh in the first three months of this year alone, in what officials now describe as the largest movement of refugees across the region since the Vietnam War.

Thailand's police chief Somyot Pumpunmuang has proposed setting up official camps to shelter Rohingya refugees where they could receive help from international agencies like the UNHCR. Similar camps were established for Vietnamese boat people in Malaysia and Indonesia following the fall of South Vietnam 40 years ago.

Thailand has also called for a summit of regional nations to discuss the crisis. Malaysian maritime police inspect one of the boats which carried Rohingya and Bangladeshi migrants in Langkawi.

Indonesia's navy on Tuesday towed a boat carrying 400 refugees out of Indonesian waters. The boat had washed ashore early on Monday in the Indonesian province of Aceh.

"We gave them fuel and asked them to proceed. We are not forcing them to go to Malaysia or Australia," navy spokesman Manahan Simorangkir said. "That is not our business. Our business is they don't enter Indonesia because Indonesia is not the destination." Officials and refugee activists fear that Thailand's crackdown is forcing traffickers to keep thousands of refugees at sea or to drive them deeper into jungle hideouts to avoid detection.

"Search and rescue will be problematic but it must be done â€“ there are up to 100,000 fishing boats in these waters. That's a lot of needles in a very big haystack," an IOM spokesman said.

But the report says the refugees then become captives of the traffickers who hold them for ransom at sea.

More than a million Rohingya Muslims live in western Myanmar, where they have faced state-sponsored persecution and attacks by Buddhist mobs over the past three years. The exodus from Myanmar has included woman and children who are initially asked to pay between $US50 and $US300 for passage on a fishing boat, many of which come from Thai ports.
