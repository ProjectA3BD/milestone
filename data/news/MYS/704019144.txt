SHAH ALAM: Grab Malaysia has denied that a man arrested by the police on Friday for allegedly raping and robbing a university student is one of their own. Grab Malaysia country head Sean Goh said the 27-year-old man had nothing to do with them as reported. "With regard to this incident, we would like to clarify that the person arrested is not a GrabCar driver and was never registered on our Grab platform," said Goh in a statement today. The suspect, who has been remanded for seven days, was believed to have committed the crime on Wednesday when he stopped the victim and pretended to ask for directions in Section 7. In the 8.30pm incident, the 22-year-old victim was walking towards a bus stop after shopping at a night market. The suspect had allegedly pulled the victim into his car, and drove towards an industrial area near an apartment in Section 7 before raping her at a secluded spot. He then took her cash of about RM100 and handphone before ordering her to get out of the vehicle. Shah Alam district police chief Assistant Commissioner Shafien Mamat said the suspect was arrested by the district Criminal Investigations Department in a 4am raid on Friday at an apartment in Port Klang. Investigators seized a knife, the car believed to have been used to commit the crime and its keys, several pieces of clothing as well as a handphone. Shafien said initial investigations revealed that the suspect acted alone. It was also later revealed that the suspect has previous convictions for house trespassing. Investigations are on-going under

Section 376 of the Penal Code for rape, and Section 392 and 397 of the same code for armed robbery. Â© New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd
