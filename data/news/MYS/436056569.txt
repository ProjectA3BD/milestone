Malaysian authorities said on Monday a cluster of abandoned jungle camps used by human traffickers contained 139 suspected graves as well as barbed-wire pens likely used to cage migrants, shedding more light on a regional trade that preyed on some of Southeast Asia’s most desperate people.

Border with Thailand

National police chief Khalid Abu Bakar said forensics experts were exhuming the suspected graves found at 28 vacated camps in the hilly jungle area on the border with Thailand where trafficking syndicates were known to operate.

“It is a very sad scene,” Khalid told reporters at a police outpost several km from the camps, one of which appeared large enough to hold about 300 people. “I am shocked. We never expected this kind of cruelty.”

At one camp, police found “a highly decomposed body” that will be examined by forensics experts as teams began the work of digging up the areas believed to be graves — mounds of earth, covered with leaves and marked by sticks, Mr. Khalid said.

“We have discovered 139 of what we believe to be graves,” he said. “We believe they are victims of human trafficking.”

The discoveries have exposed hidden networks of jungle camps run by human smugglers, who have for years held countless desperate people captive while extorting ransoms from their families.

As Southeast Asian governments have launched crackdowns in recent weeks amid intensified international pressure and media scrutiny, traffickers have abandoned camps on land and boats at sea to avoid arrest.

The findings were the result of an operation Malaysian authorities conducted from May 11-23, during which they combed the steep jungle area along 50 km of the border with Thailand. Since May 10 alone, more than 3,600 people about half of them from Bangladesh and half Rohingya from Myanmar have landed ashore in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. — AP
