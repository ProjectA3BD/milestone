KUALA LUMPUR: A security guard was sentenced to two months jail by a magistrate's court here for hitting his 63-year-old mother while he was drunk.

Magistrate Adira Adnan meted out the sentence after V. Maanikkkam, 24, pleaded guilty to the offence. She ordered the sentence to run from the day of his arrest yesterday.

Maanikkkam committed the offence against his mother M. Suparma at 1am in a flat in Dang Wangi on Aug 2.

In mitigation, Maanikkkam, who was unrepresented, said he only earns RM1,200 a month and has regretted his actions.

He said he would not do it again and asked for a minimum sentence.

According to the facts presented in court, Maanikkkam was drunk when he punched Suparma on the left cheek and mouth. He had also pulled her hair.
