KUALA LUMPUR: The "Datuk Seri" who claimed trial to assaulting three Rela personnel, was charged with testing positive for methaphetamine three years ago.

Liow Soon Hee, 29, was accused of testing positive for the drug during a urine test on Feb 1, 2014.

He was accused under Section 15(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952.

Deputy Public Prosecutor Akmal Anuar offered bail at RM4,000 with one surety.

Liow's counsel Farhana Abd Halim said that her client was a businessman and asked for a reasonable bail as her client was accused of other charges previously.

Magistrate Namirah Hanum Mohamed Albaki fixed bail at RM2,000 with one surety. She also ordered Liow to report to the nearest police station once a month pending disposal of the case.

The court later set Dec 4 for mention.

On Nov 3, the businessman claimed trial at the Sessions Court to assaulting three Rela members on duty on Oct 27.

He was re-arrested on Friday (Nov 3) in relation to the drug cases shortly after he was charged with the assault.

Liow is expected to be charged for a second drug offence later on Monday.
