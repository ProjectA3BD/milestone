: Newly appointed Attorney-General Tan Sri Apandi Ali has denied the existence of purported draft of charge sheets against Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak.He said the allegations by foreign national Clare Rewcastle Brown in political blog Sarawak Report were false."T‎he alleged charge sheets are not in and never reached the Attorney- General's Chambers. Furthermore, the format of the sheets is not correct or written by our Chambers.‎"The special task force's investigation has not been completed. So it is not legally possible for the charge sheets to be drafted in advance."These alleged charge papers, therefore, indicate that there is a conspiracy to topple a serving prime minister by criminalising him, and that the methods include doctoring and criminal leakage, " he said in a statement issued early today.Mohamed Apandi also said that the plot represented a threat to Malaysia's democracy and he would direct for all action possible to be taken to investigate the matter."The full force of the law will be applied without exception to anyone found guilty," he added.
