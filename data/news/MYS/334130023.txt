MY friend and I visited a friend in Singapore over the New Year.

We decided to take the bus for a relaxing ride.

Crossing the border and hopping onto the MRT was a breeze.

We joined the holiday crowd at food courts and shopping centres.

We were pretty amazed at the jumbo-size toilet rolls in public toilets.

After three days of good fun, laughter and food, we returned to Kuala Lumpur. As we had to stop at the Tuas Immigration, we decided to use the toilet.

Wow! What a rude shock! Dirty toilets, smelly and with overflowing bin!

City Hall has been issuing warning to eateries to clean their toilets.

What about our Immigration centres which are the first entry points into our country?

A clean toilet speaks strongly about our culture. Hello! This is not rocket science, surely we can do better?
