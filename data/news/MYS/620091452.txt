Four people, including two Bangladeshis have been held over their suspected involvement with Islamic State (IS) in Malaysia.

Both are believed to have links with IS militant groups in Bangladesh and planned to travel to the southern Philippines.

Malaysian Special Branch's Counter-Terrorism Division arrested four people, including the two Bangladeshis, in separate raids between January 13 and 19 in Kuala Lumpur and Sabah.

The Bangladeshis, aged 27 and 28, worked as salesmen, and were arrested last Thursday in Kuala Lumpur. They were suspected of having ties to suspected IS militants in Bangladesh and planning to join Dr Mahmud's terror cell.

Dr Mahmud was a former lecturer at University Malaya who had joined IS militants based in the southern Philippines.

Malaysian Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar said the arrests meant that police had effectively destroyed a new IS cell which had planned to turn Sabah into a transit station for Southeast Asia and South Asia terrorists to join a Philippines-based IS group led by Dr Mahmud Ahmad and Isnilon Hapilon.

Malaysia is a major destination for the Bangladeshi jobseekers. Around four lakh Bangladeshis are now working in the country.
