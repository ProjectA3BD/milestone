has reportedly buried 21 human trafficking victims, believed to be Rohingya refugees, in accordance with Muslim rites.

The 21 victims were among the 106 bodies found in shallow graves in 28 jungle camps along Thailand's border last month. The area was used as a transit point to hold migrants and refugees by traffickers, reported the Dawn.

The burial took place in a village in the neighbouring Kedah state. Chief Minister Mukhriz Mahathir said that probe showed that the victims had died of starvation and illness.

He added that the bodies of the other victims will be buried after autopsies are completed.

Most of the victims were migrants fleeing their homelands to reach countries like Malaysia, where they hoped to find work or live freely.
