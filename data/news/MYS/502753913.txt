Malaysia arrests suspected IS militant with weapons in Kuala Lumpur

KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Malaysian police said on Saturday they had arrested a suspected militant with weapons and documents related to the Islamic State group at a train station in the capital Kuala Lumpur.

Inspector-General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar said in a tweet that the man was arrested on Friday at a station in Jelatik, close to the centre of the city.

No further details were immediately available. Police were expected to release more details later in the day.

Malaysia has been on high alert since bomb and gun attacks in neighbouring Indonesia's capital city on Thursday.

Security has been beefed up security in public areas and the country is taking extra measures to secure border areas fearing inflitration of terrorists.

Indonesian police killed one suspected militant and arrested two more in raids across the country on Friday, a day after an attack by Islamic State suicide bombers and gunmen in Jakarta that killed seven people.
