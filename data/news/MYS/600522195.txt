Malaysian group to hold

anti—Najib rally despite ban

Malaysian pro-democracy activists have vowed to go ahead with a massive rally this weekend to demand Prime Minister Najib Razak’s resignation over a financial scandal despite a police ban and fears of clashes with a pro-government group. Najib has kept an iron grip since graft allegations emerged two years ago in the indebted 1MDB state investment fund that he founded. The fund is at the center of investigations in the U.S. and several other countries. Electoral reform group Bersih said Najib must step down to allow an independent investigation into 1MDB.

“We are taking to the street because there is something rotten in the state of Malaysia. Poor governance and a lack of accountability have resulted in grand corruption in 1MDB,” said Bersih chairwoman Maria Chin.PTI
