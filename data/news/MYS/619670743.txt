: Right wing Malay movement Perkasa has proposed that the corrupt be subjected to mandatory caning and jailed for life.Its Integrity and Anti-Corruption Bureau chairman, Jais Abdul Karim said such severe punishment equivalent to the penalty for drug trafficking must be imposed to curb corruption in the country."Thus, we urge mandatory caning and life imprisonment be imposed as we feel this commensurate with the offence," he said at the People Rising Against Corruption Forum organised by Perkasa at the Sultan Sulaiman Club here last night.Jais said the government should also introduce a new act, to called 'Sabotaging the Economy Act', to enable those being investigated for corruption to be detained indefinitely without bail.He said the act, similar to the previous Internal Security Act, was now needed towards ensuring a thorough investigation process."Indefinite detention without bail is needed so that those suspected of corruption will not have a chance to destroy evidence or influence witness(es) involved in the cases," said Jais.He also said Malaysians from all walks of life must also be brave and proactive in reporting on corruption to the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission.Such reports could also be channelled through anti-corruption NGOs which would assist in forwarding the reports to the authorities, Jais said.About 150 people attended the forum. --Bernama
