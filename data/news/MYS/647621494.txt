Bangkok: Malaysia's former opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim has filed a new legal challenge to his five-year jail sentence on sodomy charges that are widely seen as politically-motivated.

Mr Anwar's conviction in Malaysia's highest court in February 2015 barred him from running for office, in a crushing blow to the country's opposition alliance that has since splintered.

The challenge comes after the country's embattled Prime Minister Najib Razak urged supporters of his ruling coalition to take to social media ahead of elections he is likely to call this year.

"We have long been in defensive mode. Enough. It is now time to attack," said Mr Najib, who has shrugged off his alleged involvement in a multibillion dollar corruption scandal.
