Rome, Sep 26 : A Malaysian was arrested after he allegedly assaulted a couple embracing outside an Islamic cultural centre in Rome, shoving the woman and punching and kicking the man, police said on Monday.

"You can't kiss here in front of the mosque," the 24-year-old Malaysian is alleged to have shouted at the couple before attacking them as they strolled hand in hand in Rome's Esquilino district near the central station late on Sunday.

When a police patrol car intervened, the Malaysian allegedly went for the two police officers, leaving one of them with bruising.

The Malaysian faces charges of assault and of resisting a public official.

Police are investigating "the extent of radicalisation" of the Malaysian, who is resident in Rome, according to the romatoday.it website.
