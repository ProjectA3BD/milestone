IPOH: A former Hulu Perak district forestry department officer has been fined RM70, 000 in default of seven months' jail after he pleaded guilty to accepting a RM100, 000 bribe in January 2012.

Sessions Court Judge Rihaida Rafie also ordered the RM768, 970 seized during a raid in Amir Sharifudin Aliman's house on Jan 4, 2012 to be returned to the government.

She also ordered that one Bank Simpanan Nasional, 10 Amanah Saham and one Tabung Haji accounts to be closed and the money inside the accounts to be returned to the government.

Money in the 12 accounts amount to RM3, 103,324.71

Amir had in Feb 2013 claimed trial to the charge.

However, when his case was brought up for mention today, he changed his plea to guilty.

He pleaded guilty to accepting the gratification from timber contractor Ismail Abd Manas on Jan 3, 2012 in Grik in his capacity as a civil servant.

He was charged for accepting the bribe under Section 165 of the Penal Code, which carries two years' jail or fine or both upon conviction.

With his guilty plea, the Deputy Public Prosecutor's Office withdrew the remaining 13 charges against him.

Twelve of the charges were for accepting bribes while the other was for failing to abide by a Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) instructed to hand over a sworn declaration to explain his extraordinary wealth.
