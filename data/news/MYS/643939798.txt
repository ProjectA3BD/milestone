KUALA LUMPUR: The Dewan Rakyat last night passed the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill (2017) which provides mandatory whipping for sexual offenders.

Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department Razali Ibrahim said with the amendment to the Code, the mandatory whipping punishment could be handed down to offenders who committed rape, incest, consensual and non-consensual unnatural sex, and encouraged children towards acts of extreme indecency.

“The Bill is proof of the serious step taken by the government to address sex crimes which has becoming rampant in society,” he said when winding up the debate on the Bill, which was then passed with a majority vote at 11.30 pm.

The Bill also provides a mandatory jail sentence for a person who causes hurt to an ex-wife or ex-husband, children, disabled adult or other members of the family, not limited to those who are still in a valid marriage.

Razali said the amendment also expanded the provision under Section 377CA to include inserting any parts of the body, except the penis, into the vagina or anus as sexual offences, in which the offender could be prosecuted.

“The expansion and explanation on Section 377CA is part of the government’s efforts to combat sexual offences not only against children, but also against general members of the public,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Bill also includes a topic on obscene documents to strengthen the ban on the sale, distribution, possession, prohibition, leasing, production, advertising, purchase and other actions relating to such documents.

Obscene documents include photographs or visual recordings and others recorded, stored, processed and reproduced or generated by computer.
