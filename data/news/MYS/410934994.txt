KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 20, 2015:

Vocal activist Lawrence Jayaraj, who also happens to be the father of the Form three student who was barred last month from entering class for wearing a baju kurung to school, has been arrested under the Sedition Act.

The arrest apparently took place moments after Parti Sosialis Malaysia (PSM) secretary-general S. Arutchelvan was released.

Just like Arutchelvan, Jayaraj was also detained at Dang Wangi Police Headquarters, but according to Jayaraj’s lawyer Michelle Yesudas of Lawyers for Liberty it was unclear why he was arrested.

She said Jayaraj, who is also a cartoonist, could have been arrested over an allegedly seditious Facebook posting.

“No specific post is mentioned and we will only find out tomorrow from the investigating officer. It’s ridiculous that they are arresting people over the holidays.

“First Arutchelvan, Wan Ji Wan Hussin and now Lawrence. Like a sedition binge, (it is) clearly to send a message that they are clamping down on democratic space,” she told The Rakyat Post, also referring to an independent preacher who was detained last night by Selangor Islamic Religious Department (Jais) for giving a lecture without a permit in Shah Alam.

Arutchelvan was released a day after he was arrested by police under Section 4 of the Sedition Act over his statement criticising the verdict delivered on the imprisonment of Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.

Through his Twitter account recently, Inspector General of Police Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar had declared that police would crackdown on those who heavily criticised the government.

The warning came in the wake of Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim’s sentence to five years’ jail after being found guilty of sodomy, as many took to social media in condemning the judgement.
