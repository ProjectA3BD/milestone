PETALING JAYA: A former doctor was charged at the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court today with committing multiple sexual offences against a 56-year-old cleaner at a hospital here last year.

New Straits Times reported the man, Ahmad Ahnaf Kamarulhizham, 31, was slapped with two counts of forcefully inserting his finger into the woman’s vagina and also masturbating in front of the woman.

The father of two pleaded not guilty to the two charges, as well as to an alternative charge of assault with intention to outrage the modesty of the woman.

He was alleged to have committed the offences in a nursing room on the fifth floor of the Specialist Complex building at the Kuala Lumpur Hospital between 10.30am and 11.30am on March 18, 2015, said the report.

ASP Sapri Yaakub, who prosecuted, asked for the suspect to be denied bail while Ahmad Ahnaf’s counsel Fahmi Abd Moin pleaded for bail.

Fahmi said his client resigned in November last year and is currently unemployed. The accused’s wife, who is also a medical officer and six months pregnant with their third child, is supporting the family.

He said the wife also suffered from joint pains and her movement was limited.

Judge Shamsudin Abdullah set bail at RM12,000 in one surety and ordered the accused to report to the nearest police station once a month.
