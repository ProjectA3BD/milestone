KUALA LUMPUR: A hare-brained scheme to steal a senator's air conditioner units ended with the two perpetrators receiving a beating and a jail sentence after they failed to bribe their way past security.

Mohd Hairil Nizam Ab Rahman and Rozihan Ibrahim, both 31, plead guilty to stealing two air conditioner compressor units from the offices of Senator Datuk Dr Lee Chong Meng.

According to the statement of facts, the duo were caught red-handed trying to cart away the compressors by security on Feb 22 at 6.30am.

Mohd Hairil and Rozihan attempted to pay off the guards with RM1,500, although the stolen units were valued at about RM1,000.

However, the guards rejected the money and handed the two to the police.

In mitigation, their lawyer Mohamad Zaidi explained that Mohd Hairil hatched the plan after being laid off from a restaurant close to the crime scene at the Mutiara Complex on Jalan Ipoh here.

He found several defunct air conditioners and asked for Rozihan, who works as an air-conditioner technician, to fix the items.

However, while trying to remove the compressors, the two were accosted by guards and then beaten up.

Mohd Hairil and Rozihan admitted that the act could appear to look like a crime, and apologised for their actions.

DPP Noor Jazilah Mohd Yushaa told the Court that the two still needed to be punished to teach them a lesson.

Magistrate Ashraf Rezal Abdul Manan said that while the stolen items did not have a high value, the sentence needed to reflect that they had stolen from a member of the Dewan Negara, a senator.

He sentenced the duo to a month in prison.
