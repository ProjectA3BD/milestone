KUALA LUMPUR: Two teenagers who were charged with the murder of 23 people in a tahfiz school fire, were acquitted and discharged by the child court today for drug abuse charges.

The prosecution withdrew the charges against the 16-year-old and 12-year-old following results of a pathology report that revealed there was no traces of drugs in their urine samples.

Lawyer Noor Svetlana Mohd Nordin, who represented the 12- year-old juvenile, said the prosecution withdrew the charge as the urine pathology report showed a negative result. “It means there were no drugs in the urine,” said Noor Svetlana.

Lawyer Joanne Chua, who represented the 16-year-old also confirmed that the prosecution had withdrawn the charge against her client as the results from the pathology report were negative.

They were charged under Section 15(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, for drug consumption.

Another 16 year-old accused had claimed trial on a similar charge of consuming drugs and the matter was fixed for mention on Jan 3, 2018.

Meanwhile, two brothers, who were also facing charges for consuming drugs (cannabis) under Section 15(1)(a), had pleaded guilty and were jailed for two months from their date of arrest on Sept 16. They are now free as they have completed serving their two months sentence.

Magistrate Zilfinaz Abbas also imposed RM5,000 bonds without sureties, each, for two years.

Their mothers are to accompany them to the National Anti-Drugs Agency, twice a month for two years.

On Sept 28, five teenagers including two who are facing a charge of murdering students and teachers at a religious school in Kampung Datuk Keramat, and a 12-year-old boy, were charged in two separate magistrate’s courts for ganja and syabu consumption.

The two accused, aged 16, pleaded guilty to committing the offence in a toilet at D7, Criminal Investigation Department, Contingent Police Headquarters, at about 11.35am on Sept 16.
