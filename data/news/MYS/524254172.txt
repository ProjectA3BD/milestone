LANGKAWI: A suspected serial rapist who used the WeChat mobile app to lure victims was arrested by the police in Langkawi.

A police team nabbed the 19-year-old former hotel employee, based on information from an alleged rape victim who spotted him driving a car here, with a woman believed to be his next victim.

Langkawi police chief Supt Dr Che Ghazali Che Awang said the suspect, from Alor Setar, was believed to have just arrived on the island with his latest victim when he was caught.

He said initial police investigations revealed that the suspect, nicknamed “Solleh”, was involved in 10 rape cases involving teenage girls, reported at several districts in Kedah and Kuala Lumpur.

“His modus operandi was to use ‘Nearby Search’ in WeChat to zero in on an intended victim before luring the girl to a quiet place to rape her,” he told reporters here yesterday.

He said the suspect had been on the prowl since last October, targeting victims who were aged between 16 and 18. — Bernama
