A Sydney mother has avoided a mandatory death sentence after being found not guilty of smuggling crystal methamphetamine into Malaysia. The not guilty verdict in the trial of Maria Elvira Pinto Exposto was handed down on Wednesday in Malaysia's High Court. The 54-year-old claimed she was the victim of a set-up after she was found with more than a kilogram of methamphetamine in her bag after arriving in Kuala Lumpur on a flight from China in 2014. The judge on Wednesday found that an online boyfriend had scammed her and she was acquitted of the charges against her, media reports said. The prosecution agreed after the verdict that the mother of four could be deported to Australia.
