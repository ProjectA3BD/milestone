: The use of communications technology like the WhatsApp messenger, which enables the formation of chat groups, has become one of the latest measures to combat crime such as house break-ins, snatch thefts and car thefts.This is seen to be effective, especially in crime-prone housing areas and parks, besides the conventional means such as area patrols by the police and residents' associations, and the setting up of police beats.Information relayed via a WhatsApp group comprising residents of a housing area can help save a house from being broken into by thieves, with the help of the residents themselves which enables police to act fast upon receiving the tip-off.The Taman Keramat AU2 experienc, for example, where the residents share information to prevent house break-ins through WhatsApp should be replicated by other residential communities in fighting crime.AU2 Security and Community Movement chief, Ismail Mohd Rashid, 46, said the idea came about after hearing residents lamenting about the frequent house break-in incidents in the area over the last number of years.Ismail said he and some residents started forming their WhatsApp group called 'Keselamatan AU2' (AU2 Security) in 2015, now comprising hundreds from the neighbourhood, with police assistance in monitoring the area.He said the formationn of the WhatsApp group was to ease communication and sharing of information on security problems and on anything suspicious happening in their housing area."Since the residents here have been cooperating well in combating crime, we have not heard of any case of house break-in occurring here."Also perhaps after the residents started being active in conducting crime-prevention patrols under the Rukun Tetangga Sector's (RTS) Voluntary Patrol Scheme," he said when met by Bernama, here, recently..Ismail said residents conducting patrols in this housing area had also been issuing notices reminding residents who often forgot to lock their house and so on.Taman Seri Gombak 'A' RTS chairman, Abdul Hamid Mohamed Yusof said after not holding any activities for the past 10 years, the area's RTS unexpectedy became active again after he and some residents set up the 'Warga Prihatin Seri Gombak' (WPSG) group, in May last year."Through this association, we have been organising various activities including crime-prevention patrols, participated by 40 residents and the police."We also communicate through two WhatsApp groups involving 600 residents to share information on any crime incident or on anything suspicious for action to be taken."It is our effort at overcoming the problem of house break-in which was previously rampant," he said.Abdul Hamid, who is also known as "Papa Black", said upon receiving information on anything suspicious happening in their housing area through the WhatsApp group, residents and police who read the messages would rush to the location."Many house break-in attempts have been foiled since, through this action," he said."The latest is that, we are grateful for having a Taman Seri Gombak RTS operations room, launched last Dec 31, as a place for us to gather or hold meetings," he added.-- BERNAMA
