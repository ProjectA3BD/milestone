In her writ filed with the court, Mrs Chong said her husband had been seated in business class seat 1C on the doomed March 8, 2014, flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when it disappeared.

Mrs Chong said that in late January 2015, the Malaysian Department of Civil Aviation declared the plane's disappearance had been an accident and there were no survivors.
