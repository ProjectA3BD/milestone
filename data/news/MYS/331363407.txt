AJINOMOTO (Malaysia) Berhad donated 3,000 cartons of their Tumix Kuah Gravy Enhancer, worth over RM140,000, to the Malaysian Red Crescent to ease food preparation efforts at flood evacuation relief centres at the height of the floods in the east coast.

Over 200,000 people had been evacuated to relief centres and this had put a huge strain on resources, especially the need to provide properly-cooked meals to the evacuees.

Ajinomoto (Malaysia) Berhad realised there was a need for something that will save the food preparation teams a lot of time, effort and resources.

Tumix Kuah would reduce or even eliminate the need to use salt, garlic and onions, as it already contains these ingredients.

Ajinomoto (Malaysia) Berhad hopes the donation would make it easier for the food preparation volunteers to provide proper, nutritious and tasty cooked meals to victims.

The company is also looking into other ways to help in the relief efforts and is proud to help the many volunteers and relief agencies who are working tirelessly to help their fellow Malaysians in this time of great need.
