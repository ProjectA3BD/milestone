TAIPEI， April 16 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan police on Saturday released 20 fraud suspects who were deported from Malaysia Friday evening， citing a lack of evidence.

Most of the suspects wore masks upon their arrival at Taipei Taoyuan International Airport.

Taiwan police released all of them at about 2 a.m. Saturday due to "incomplete evidence for any crime and a lack of arrest warrants."

They were among 52 people from Taiwan arrested in Malaysia for suspected telecommunication fraud.

Late last month， Malaysian and Chinese mainland police cooperated on an investigation into five transnational telecommunication fraud cases involving victims on the mainland， and arrested a total of 119 suspects， including 65 from the mainland， 52 from Taiwan and two from Malaysia.
