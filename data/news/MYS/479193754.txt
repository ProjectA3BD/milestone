Bangkok: Malaysia's government has embarked on a "binge" of prosecutions against its critics, using criminal laws to crush peaceful expression, according to Human Rights Watch.

In a new 145-page report, Human Rights Watch documents the arrests of scores of people with critical views, including opposition politicians, activists, journalists and ordinary citizens, as well as the suspension of two critical newspapers, the blocking of websites and the declaration that peaceful protests were unlawful.

The New York-based organisation released the report on Tuesday, ahead of a summit of world leaders in Kuala Lumpur next month, expected to include US President Barack Obama and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.

Revealing details of little-known cases, Human Rights Watch said the summit will present an opportunity for world leaders to press Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak to reform draconian laws and end censorship.
