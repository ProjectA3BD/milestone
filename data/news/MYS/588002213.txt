MANILA â€¢ The Philippine police on Monday said they had thwarted an attempt by a terrorist bomb expert to stage attacks in the heart of Metro Manila.

Malaysian Mohamas Amin, who had a 600,000 Philippine peso (S$17,000) bounty on his head, was presented at a press briefing by Chief Superintendent Roel Obusan, acting director of the PNP-Criminal Investigation and Detection Group.

Amin was arrested at 4am on Oct 8 during a raid in Quezon City. Also arrested were Bilal Taalam, the owner of the house where Amin was staying, and another man, Adnan Malangkis. They are believed to have links with Abu Sayyaf militants in Sulu. Eight other tenants in the house are being investigated.

Recovered during the raid were a fragmentation grenade, several rounds of ammunition, identification cards, a blueprint of a condo mall in Quezon City and a mobile phone.

Chief Supt Obusan refused to name the condo mall, to avoid causing panic. He said police interrogation of the suspects strengthened their belief that Amin was planning to stage bomb attacks.

Amin, who also goes by the names Asman, Akman Amin and Amin Aklam, is the subject of an arrest warrant for a murder case in Jolo, Sulu.

He and Malangkis were subjected to inquest proceedings for violations of the firearms Act and illegal possession of explosives.

Amin will also be charged for concealing his true identity.

Taalam was charged with obstruction of justice and harbouring a fugitive or wanted person.
