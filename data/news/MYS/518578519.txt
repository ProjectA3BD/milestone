KUALA LUMPUR: A single mother, who was accused of throwing her newborn from the 18th floor of her flat, has been charged with murder at the magistrate's court here.

Norazwani Mohd Noh was charged under Section 302 of the Penal Code with murder on Monday at 11.15am.

Norazwani told the court that she understood the charge against her after it was read out.

Magistrate Siti Radziah Kamarudin set May 9 for mention pending chemical and post-mortem reports.

The 38-year-old real estate agent is believed to have thrown her baby from the 18th floor of Block C of her flat in Danau Kota, Setapak, on Feb 29 around 8.11am, soon after giving birth to her child.

Norazwani is being held at Hospital Kuala Lumpur where she is also receiving treatment.

The accused from Seremban had been renting the unit with a married couple and had been living there along with her five-year-old daughter.

Police had said that Norazwani was in the process of divorcing her husband and that they were trying to track him down to help in investigations.
