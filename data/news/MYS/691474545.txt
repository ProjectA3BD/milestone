KUALA LUMPUR: Seven Filipino men, suspected to be part of the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), were detained in raids here on Sept 14, says Tan Sri Mohamad Fuzi Harun.

"This is our follow-up operations after several ASG operatives, who were planning attacks during National Day and closing of the SEA Games, were detained.

"All seven suspects aged between 22 and 38 were working as security guards in private companies in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor," the Inspector-General of Police said in a statement Thursday.

One of the suspects - a 22-year-old man - was involved in clashes with Philippines security forces and kidnappings, he added.

"The suspects gained entry into Malaysia through Sandakan in Sabah before heading to Kuala Lumpur in September 2015.

"They used forged identification documents," Fuzi said.

He said Bukit Aman will continue its operations against foreign terrorists who are planning to use Malaysia as transit and hideout.

"Since early this year, 41 foreign fighters have been detained," he said.
