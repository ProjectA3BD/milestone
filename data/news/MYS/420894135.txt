PETALING JAYA: Batu PKR MP Tian Chua has been arrested ahead of Saturday's #KitaLawan rally in Kuala Lumpur, according to PKR.

In a brief statement, the party confirmed the PKR vice-president's arrest and his presence at the Jinjang police station.

"I am arrested at Kg Batu Muda Community Hall after the town hall meeting. A group of 20 policemen arrested me soon after the meeting ended," he tweeted, Saturday.

This is Chua's second arrest in one week, as he was arrested last Friday over his involvement in the weekly rally aimed to free Opposition leader Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim from jail.

He was however freed the next day as the courts rejected the police request to remand him further.

The party added that Pandan MP Rafizi Ramli and social activist Hishammuddin Rais would be remanded for three days after their arrest on Friday.

Their arrests were followed by the arrest of PAS deputy president Mohamad Sabu in Seberang Jaya on Friday night.

Mat Sabuâ€™s arrest is believed to be related to his involvement in the planned rally.

The first #KitaLawan rally was held on March 7 outside the Sogo Shopping Centre in Kuala Lumpur.

The rally was also expected to gatecrash the wedding reception of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak's daughter.

His daughter, Nooryana Najwa was married to Kazakhtan national Daniyar Kessikbayev last week.

Najib and his wife Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor, together with Daniyar's family are currently holding a wedding reception at the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre (KLCC).
