Bangkok: Myanmar is threatening to boycott a summit of South-east Asian nations to discuss a spiralling humanitarian crisis that is endangering thousands of boat people stranded in the Malacca Strait and Andaman Sea.

The threat comes as the country that was praised by Western nations three years ago for ending decades of brutal military rule faces growing criticism over its harsh treatment of Rohingya Muslims.

"We are unlikely to attend ... we do not accept it if they [Thailand] are inviting us just to ease the pressure they are facing," said Myanmar's presidential office director Zaw Htay.

"The root cause [of the crisis] is increasing human trafficking," he said.
