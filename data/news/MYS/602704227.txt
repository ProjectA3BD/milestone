NIBONG TEBAL: Illegal demonstrations can destroy the harmony of the nation, according to Minister in the Prime Minister's Department, Tan Sri Joseph Kurup (pix).

"Unity is what holds the people together and as a citizen, everyone must do their part in protecting the country.

"Those who attend illegal demonstrations have no respect for the sovereignty of the law that had been set in the constitution," he said during the launching of the state appreciation 'Demi Negara' programme at Bukit Jawi resort here today.

On Nov 19, both Bersih and Red Shirts staged rallies deemed illegal by the Royal Malaysian Police. However, there were no reports of unfavourable incidents during the rally.

The minister also said the country needed laws such as the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 to maintain peace and harmony in the country.

"As a responsible citizen, we must follow the law that had been set and if we go beyond it, the harmony that we have privilege of, will be destroyed," he said.

Bersih 2.0 chairman Maria Chin Abdullah has been detained under the act for alleged involvement in an activity that could harm parliamentary democracy. â€” Bernama
